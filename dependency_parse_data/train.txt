A glacier cave is a cave formed within the ice of a glacier .
Glacier caves are often called ice caves , but this term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice .
How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion
In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path .
It can be uniform , with constant angular rate of rotation ( and constant speed ) , or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation .
The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts .
The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body .
Examples of circular motion include : an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height , a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles , a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism .
Since the object 's velocity vector is constantly changing direction , the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation .
Without this acceleration , the object would move in a straight line , according to Newton 's laws of motion .
how did apollo creed die
Apollo Creed is a fictional character from the Rocky films , initially portrayed as the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World .
He was played by Carl Weathers .
Creed had multiple nicknames , including The Master of Disaster , The King of Sting , The Dancing Destroyer , The Prince of Punch , The One and Only and The Count of Monte Fisto .
Urban legend states that Apollo Creed 's name is a wordplay on the Apostles ' Creed , a statement of belief used in Christian churches .
All of Apollo 's championship fights were scheduled for the 15 round distance .
Championship fights did not convert from 15 rounds to 12 rounds until 1987 .
Rocky Balboa is often wrongly credited with popularizing the red , white , and blue trunks ; Creed was the first man to wear them ( latterly worn by Rocky Balboa in the 3rd and 4th installments and finally by Tommy `` The Machine '' Gunn ( Tommy Morrison ) in the 5th installment ) although normally he wore red and white , as seen in Rocky II .
Balboa 's signature colors were black and gold—colors he used in the latest movie .
how long is the term for federal judges
In the United States , the title of federal judge usually means a judge appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution .
In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals ( also called `` circuit courts '' ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts .
Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court , Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts .
All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as `` Article III judges '' because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III .
Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as `` federal judges '' ; however , they are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article I instead .
See Article I and Article III tribunals .

how a vul works
Variable Universal Life Insurance ( often shortened to VUL ) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value .
In a VUL , the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts , similar to mutual funds , and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner .
The 'variable ' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets .
The 'universal ' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments .
The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance .
This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically can not be missed without lapsing the policy ( although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature , or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium ) .
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance , because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy .
With most if not all VULs , unlike whole life , there is no endowment age ( the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount , which for whole life is typically 100 ) .
This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life .
With a typical whole life policy , the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy , and at endowment age , the face amount is all that is paid out .
Thus with either death or endowment , the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years .
However , some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase `` paid up additions '' to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time .
If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company , a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life .
The combination over the years of no endowment age , continually increasing death benefit , and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy , this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums .

how big is the purdue greek system
University Hall
Purdue University , located in West Lafayette , Indiana , is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system .
Purdue was founded on May 6 , 1869 , as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly , taking advantage of the Morrill Act , accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science , technology , and agriculture in his name .
The first classes were held on September 16 , 1874 , with six instructors and 39 students .
Today , Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference , and is a well known world-class research institution .
Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States .
Purdue offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in over 211 major areas of study , and is well known for its competitive engineering curricula .
The university has also been highly influential in America 's history of aviation , having established the first college credit offered in flight training , the first four-year bachelor 's degree in aviation , and the first university airport ( Purdue University Airport ) .
Purdue 's aviation technology program remains one of the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world .
In the mid-20th century , Purdue 's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced spaceflight technology giving rise to Purdue 's nickname , Cradle of Astronauts .
Twenty-three Purdue graduates have gone on to become astronauts , including Gus Grissom ( one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts ) , Neil Armstrong ( the first person to walk on the moon ) , and Eugene Cernan ( the most recent person to walk on the moon ) .
how big do sebaceous cysts get
A sebaceous cyst ( ) is a term that loosely refers to either epidermoid cysts ( also known as epidermal cysts ; L72.0 ) or pilar cysts ( also known as trichilemmal cysts ; L72.1 ) .
Because an epidermoid cyst originates in the epidermis and a pilar cyst originates from hair follicles , by definition , neither type of cyst is strictly a sebaceous cyst .
The name is regarded as a misnomer as the fatty , white , semi-solid material in both of these cyst entities is not sebum , but keratin .
Furthermore , under the microscope neither entity contains sebaceous glands .
In practice , however , the terms are often used interchangeably .
`` True '' sebaceous cysts are relatively rare and are known as steatocystomas or , if multiple , as steatocystoma multiplex .
how are pointe shoes made
Modern pointe shoes .
The edge of the toe pad , which is inserted between the foot and toe box for cushioning , can be seen on the right foot .
A pointe shoe is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work .
Pointe shoes developed from the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph -like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe ( on the tips of their toes ) for extended periods of time .
They are normally worn by female dancers , though male dancers may wear them for unorthodox roles such as the ugly stepsisters in Cinderella , Bottom in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , or men performing as women in dance companies such as Les Ballets Trockadero and Grandiva .
They are manufactured in a variety of colors , most commonly in shades of light pink .
how much is 1 tablespoon of water
This tablespoon has a capacity of about 15 mL .
Measuring Spoons
In the US and parts of Canada , a tablespoon is the largest type of spoon used for eating from a bowl .
In the UK , Europe and most Commonwealth countries , a tablespoon is a type of large spoon usually used for serving .
In countries where a tablespoon is a serving spoon , the nearest equivalent to the US tablespoon is either the dessert spoon or the soup spoon .
A tablespoonful , nominally the capacity of one tablespoon , is commonly used as a measure of volume in cooking .
It is abbreviated as T , tb , tbs , tbsp , tblsp , or tblspn .
The capacity of ordinary tablespoons is not regulated by law and is subject to considerable variation .
In the USA one tablespoon ( measurement unit ) is approximately 15 mL ; the capacity of an actual tablespoon ( dining utensil ) ranges from 7 mL to 14 mL .
In Australia one tablespoon ( measurement unit ) is 20 mL .

how a rocket engine works
RS-68 being tested at NASA 's Stennis Space Center .
The nearly transparent exhaust is due to this engine 's exhaust being mostly superheated steam ( water vapor from its propellants , hydrogen and oxygen )
Viking 5C rocket engine
A rocket engine , or simply `` rocket '' , is a jet engine that uses only stored propellant mass for forming its high speed propulsive jet .
Rocket engines are reaction engines and obtain thrust in accordance with Newton 's third law .
Since they need no external material to form their jet , rocket engines can be used for spacecraft propulsion as well as terrestrial uses , such as missiles .
Most rocket engines are internal combustion engines , although non-combusting forms also exist .
Rocket engines as a group have the highest exhaust velocities , are by far the lightest , but are the least propellant efficient of all types of jet engines .

how are cholera and typhus transmitted and prevented
Cholera is an infection in the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae .
The main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting .
Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces ( waste product ) of an infected person , including one with no apparent symptoms .
The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance , and death in some cases .
The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy , typically with oral rehydration solution , to replace water and electrolytes .
If this is not tolerated or does not provide improvement fast enough , intravenous fluids can also be used .
Antibacterial drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its duration and severity .
Worldwide , it affects 3–5 million people and causes 100,000–130,000 deaths a year .
Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by epidemiological methods .
how old is sybil vane in the picture of dorian gray
The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde , appearing as the lead story in Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine on 20 June 1890 , printed as the July 1890 issue of this magazine .
The magazine 's editors feared the story was indecent as submitted , so they censored roughly 500 words , without Wilde 's knowledge , before publication .
But even with that , the story was still greeted with outrage by British reviewers , some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds , leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press .
Wilde later revised the story for book publication , making substantial alterations , deleting controversial passages , adding new chapters and including an aphoristic Preface which has since become famous in its own right .
The amended version was published by Ward , Lock and Company in April 1891 .
Some scholars believe that Wilde would today have wanted us to read the version he originally submitted to Lippincott 's .
The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray , the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward .
Basil is impressed by Dorian 's beauty and becomes infatuated with him , believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art .
Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton , a friend of Basil 's , and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry 's world view .
Espousing a new hedonism , Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfilment of the senses .
Realizing that one day his beauty will fade , Dorian ( whimsically ) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than he .
Dorian 's wish is fulfilled , and when he subsequently pursues a life of debauchery , the portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul , with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form , or through a sign of aging .
The Picture of Dorian Gray is considered a work of classic Gothic fiction with a strong Faustian theme .

how active can one be with copd
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , also known as chronic obstructive lung disease ( COLD ) , chronic obstructive airway disease ( COAD ) , chronic airflow limitation ( CAL ) and chronic obstructive respiratory disease ( CORD ) , is the occurrence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema , a pair of commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways narrow over time .
This limits airflow to and from the lungs , causing shortness of breath ( dyspnea ) .
In clinical practice , COPD is defined by its characteristically low airflow on lung function tests .
In contrast to asthma , this limitation is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time .
COPD is caused by noxious particles or gas , most commonly from tobacco smoking , which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung .
The diagnosis of COPD requires lung function tests .
Important management strategies are smoking cessation , vaccinations , rehabilitation , and drug therapy ( often using inhalers ) .
Some patients go on to require long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation .
Worldwide , COPD ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in 1990 .
It is projected to become the fourth leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 , due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in many countries .
COPD is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. , and the economic burden of COPD in the U.S. in 2007 was $ 42.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity .

how deep can be drill for deep underwater
Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 feet .
By this definition , there are approximately 600 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico .
It has been economically infeasible for many years , but with rising oil prices , more companies are investing in this area .
Major companies working in this sector include Diamond Offshore , TransOcean , and Baker Hughes .
There are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs : semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships .
Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar ( platform ) or tension-leg platform .
Recent industry analysis has estimated that the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure market will reach $ 145bn in 2011 .
“Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water .
You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.” ... Using sonic equipment , oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil .
Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit ( MODU ) to dig the initial well .
Some units are converted into production rigs , meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it 's found .
Most of the time , the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.” ... The MODU 's job is to drill down into the ocean 's floor to find oil deposits .
The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser .
The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig .
Engineers lower a drill string -- a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit -- through the riser.”
“The expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields ... ”
In 2010 a large explosion occurred killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico while a BP oil rig was drilling in deep waters .
“ ... Despite the risks , the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the Mediterranean and off the coast of East Africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas.”
“The reason for the resumption of such drilling , analyst say , is continuing high demand for energy worldwide.”
America needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that come with deepwater drilling in order for Americans to continue to carry on their everyday lives .
“The Energy Department recently projected that gulf oil production would expand from its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day , still nearly a quarter of total domestic production , to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.”
Deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways .
Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome .
Oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive .
On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too .
In time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in .
Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen .
”Cameras on rovers at the bottom of the wells record footage and take photos of rare fish that are in there natural habitat , giving scientist a look at animals they rarely seen” ( Chevron Corporation ) . ''

how are the archegonia of the fern and pine cone similar
A fern is any one or more of a group of about 12,000 species of plants belonging to the botanical group known as Pteridophyta .
Unlike mosses , they have xylem and phloem ( making them vascular plants ) .
They have stems , leaves , and roots like other vascular plants .
Ferns reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers .
By far the largest group of ferns is the leptosporangiate ferns , but ferns as defined here ( also called monilophytes ) include horsetails , whisk ferns , marattioid ferns , and ophioglossoid ferns .
The term pteridophyte also refers to ferns and a few other seedless vascular plants ( see classification section below ) .
Ferns first appear in the fossil record 360 million years ago in the Carboniferous but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous ( after flowering plants came to dominate many environments ) .
Ferns are not of major economic importance , but some are grown or gathered for food , as ornamental plants , for remediating contaminated soils , and have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the air .
Some are significant weeds .
They also play a role in mythology , medicine , and art .
how long is a flat membrane roof good for ?
Flat roofs in Israel
Flat roof in Los Angeles
A flat roof is a type of covering for a building .
In contrast to the more sloped form of roof , a flat roof is horizontal or nearly horizontal .
The slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch : Roofs which are nearly flat are known as low-pitch roofs ( as the angle of slope increases , so the pitch is said to increase ) .
Any sheet of material used to cover a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof area .
Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system .
Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof , though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry .
Gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground , or better , into a specially made soakaway .
Gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area .
Occasionally flat roofs though are designed to collect water in a pool , usually for aesthetic purposes , or for rainwater buffering .
Flat roofs exist all over the world and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials used .
In warmer climes where rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur , many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available .
In areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak , or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to 'blowing ' ( breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms ) these roofs are not suitable .
Traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertight .
The tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the sun 's heat , UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation .
Roof decking is usually of plywood , chipboard or OSB boards ( OSB = Oriented Strand Board , also known as Sterling board ) of around 18mm thickness .
The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid , heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper ' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled , the gravel is spread evenly over it .
A main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing , thus exposing it to weather and sun whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets in .
Tarpaper is usually a 'paper ' or fibre material soaked or impregnated in tar .
As gravel can not protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands , tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel applied to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of gravel is stuck to it in order to give it ongoing protection .
Tarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful results .
In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic ' tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them , however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable .
There are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of their performance and availability .
If a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath it .
This can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure .
There are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores : the severity of this health risk remains a debated point .
One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering ( be it traditional or a modern membrane ) it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen .
Thus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair it .
Once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens .
how cds are read
A CD-ROM ( ) is a pre-pressed compact disc which contains data .
The name is an acronym which stands for `` Compact Disc Read-only memory `` .
Computers can read CD-ROMs , but can not write on them .
CD-ROMs are popularly used to distribute computer software , including video games and multimedia applications , though any data can be stored ( up to the capacity limit of a disc ) .
Some CDs , called enhanced CDs , hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player , while data ( such as software or digital video ) is only usable on a computer ( such as ISO 9660 format PC CD-ROMs ) .
The Yellow Book is the technical standard that defines the format of CD-ROMs .
One of a set of color-bound books that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats , the Yellow Book , created by Sony and Philips , was the first extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio .
It adapted the format to hold any form of data .
how much is jk rowling worth
Joanne `` Jo '' Rowling ( ) , ( born 31 July 1965 ) , pen name J. K. Rowling , is a British novelist , best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series .
The Potter books have gained worldwide attention , won multiple awards , and sold more than 400 million copies .
They have become the best-selling book series in history , and been the basis for a series of films which has become the highest-grossing film series in history .
Rowling had overall approval on the scripts as well as maintaining creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment .
Born in Yate , Gloucestershire , Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 .
The seven-year period that followed entailed the death of her mother , divorce from her first husband and poverty until Rowling finished the first novel in the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( 1997 ) .
Rowling subsequently published 6 sequels—the last , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ( 2007 ) —as well as 3 supplements to the series .
In 2012 , Rowling parted with her agency and resumed writing in the form of a tragicomedy novel aimed at adult readership , entitled The Casual Vacancy .
Rowling has said she is currently working on two books—one aimed for adults , the other for children younger than the Harry Potter audience , and she expects the latter to be published first .
Rowling has led a `` rags to riches `` life story , in which she progressed from living on state benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years .
She is the United Kingdom 's best-selling author since records began , with sales in excess of £238m .
The 2008 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling 's fortune at £560 million ( $ 798 million ) , ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the United Kingdom .
Forbes ranked Rowling as the forty-eighth most powerful celebrity of 2007 , and TIME magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year , noting the social , moral , and political inspiration she has given her fans .
In October 2010 , Rowling was named the `` Most Influential Woman in Britain '' by leading magazine editors .
She has become a notable philanthropist , supporting such charities as Comic Relief , One Parent Families , Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Lumos ( formerly the Children 's High Level Group ) .

how are tropical storms and hurricanes named
Hurricane Isabel ( 2003 ) as seen from orbit during Expedition 7 of the International Space Station .
The eye , eyewall , and surrounding rainbands , characteristics of tropical cyclones , are clearly visible in this view from space .
A tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center surrounded by a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain .
Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises , resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air .
They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters , European windstorms , and polar lows .
The characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere , the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings ; a phenomenon called `` warm core `` storm systems .
The term `` tropical '' refers both to the geographical origin of these systems , which usually form in tropical regions of the globe , and to their formation in maritime tropical air masses .
The term `` cyclone '' refers to such storms ' cyclonic nature , with counterclockwise wind flow in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern Hemisphere .
The opposite direction of the wind flow is a result of the Coriolis force .
Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane ( , ) , typhoon ( ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone .
While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain , they are also able to produce high waves , damaging storm surge , and tornadoes .
They develop over large bodies of warm water , and lose their strength if they move over land due to increased surface friction and loss of the warm ocean as an energy source .
This is why coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone , while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong winds .
Heavy rains , however , can produce significant flooding inland , and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline .
Although their effects on human populations can be devastating , tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions .
They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes , which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism .
As a result , tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth 's troposphere , and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide .
Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable .
The background environment is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the Madden-Julian oscillation , El Niño-Southern Oscillation , and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation .
Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics .
Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere ; if the conditions remain favorable , the tropical disturbance intensifies , and can even develop an eye .
On the other end of the spectrum , if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall , the system weakens and eventually dissipates .
It is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology .

how long was richard nixon a president
Richard Milhous Nixon ( January 9 , 1913 – April 22 , 1994 ) was the 37th President of the United States , serving from 1969 to 1974 , when he became the only president to resign the office .
Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 .
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California .
He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937 , returning to California to practice law .
He and his wife , Pat Nixon , moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942 .
He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II .
Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 .
His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence .
He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election .
Nixon served for eight years as vice president .
He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962 .
In 1968 , he ran again for the presidency and was elected .
Although Nixon initially escalated America 's involvement in the Vietnam War , he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973 .
Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year .
Domestically , his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states .
Among other things , he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls , enforced desegregation of some Southern schools , and established the Environmental Protection Agency .
Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration .
He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972 .
Nixon 's second term saw an Arab oil embargo , the resignation of his vice president , Spiro Agnew , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration .
The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office .
After his resignation , he controversially received a pardon issued by his successor , Gerald Ford .
In retirement , Nixon 's work as an elder statesman , authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips , helped to rehabilitate his public image .
He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 .
how did bleeding sumner lead to the civil war
{ { Infobox Senator
The Dominican Republic annexation treaty caused bitter contention between President Grant and Sen. Sumner .
Brady 1869 ] ]
Sen. Sumner , opposed to American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti , became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty , and that men close to the president shared in the corruption .
As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Sen. Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18 , 1870 .
Sen. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State , Bancroft Davis , that U.S . Naval ships were being used to protect President Báez .
Sen. Sumner 's committee voted against annexation and at Sen. Sumner’s suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment , the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session .
President Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14 , 1870 , and May 31 , 1870 .
In closed session , Sen. Sumner spoke out against the treaty ; warnng that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals , noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island , and the risk that the independence of Haiti , recognized by the United States in 1862 , would be lost .
Sumner stated that Grant 's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional .
Finally , on June 30 , 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage .
The following day , President Grant , feeling betrayed by Sen. Sumner , retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner’s close friend J. Lothrop Motley , Ambassador to Britain .
By autumn , Sumner 's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge , and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned , rather than let Grant have his way .
The two men , friends until then , cooled into bitter enemies .
In December , 1870 , still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow , Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct .
Already , President Grant , supported by his Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Although Sumner stated he was an `` Administration man '' , in addition to having stopped Grant 's Dominican Republic treaty attempt , Sumner had defeated Grant 's full repeal of the Tenure of Office Act , blocked Grant 's nomination of Alexander Stewart to U.S. Secretary of Treasury , and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go .
Grant resented Sumner 's superiority of manner , as well .
Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible , the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised : `` he did n't write it . ''
As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased , Sumner’s health began to decline .
When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4 , 1871 , Senators affiliated with President Grant , known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen. Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship .
how are business ethics different in Africa and United States
Business ethics ( also corporate ethics ) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment .
It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations .
Business ethics has both normative and descriptive dimensions .
As a corporate practice and a career specialization , the field is primarily normative .
Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods .
The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns .
Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s , both within major corporations and within academia .
For example , today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters .
Adam Smith said , `` People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ''
Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions .
Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control .
The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes .
how bad burns go to burn center
A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation .
Most burns affect only the superficial skin ( known as superficial or first degree ) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin ( known as partial thickness or second degree ) .
Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues , such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness ( third degree ) or fourth degree .
The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn .
Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers .
Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low body temperature .
Partial thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings .
Blisters should typically be left unbroken .
Full thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting and extensive burns often require large amount of intravenous fluids .
The most common complications of burns are related to infection .
While large burns can be fatal , modern treatments developed in the last 50 years have significantly improved the outcomes , especially in children and young adults .
Globally about 11 million people seek medical treatment and 300,000 people die from burns .
In the United States , of those admitted to a burn center , approximately 4 % die from their injuries .
The long term outcome is primarily related to the size of burn and the age of the person effected .
how deep is the atlantic ocean
The Atlantic Ocean , not including Arctic and Antarctic regions
This video was taken by the crew of Expedition 29 on board the ISS .
The pass starts from just north-east of the Island of Newfoundland over the North Atlantic Ocean to central Africa , over South Sudan .
The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world 's oceanic divisions .
With a total area of about , it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth 's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area .
The first part of its name refers to Atlas of Greek mythology , making the Atlantic the `` Sea of Atlas '' .
The oldest known mention of `` Atlantic '' is in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC ( Hdt . 1.202.4 ) : Atlantis thalassa ( Greek : Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα ; English : Sea of Atlas ) .
The term Ethiopic Ocean , derived from Ethiopia , was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century .
Before Europeans discovered other oceans , the term `` ocean '' itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the Strait of Gibraltar that we now know as the Atlantic .
The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a gigantic river encircling the world .
The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated , S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east , and the Americas to the west .
As one component of the interconnected global ocean , it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean ( which is sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic ) , to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest , the Indian Ocean in the southeast , and the Southern Ocean in the south .
( Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica . )
The equator subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean .
how are storm names determined ?
Due to their long-term persistence , and the need for a unique identifier in issuing forecasts and warnings , tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are given names according to policy ( see Tropical cyclone naming ) .
The following are lists from which these tropical and subtropical cyclone names are derived .
how big or small a visible light can get
White light is dispersed by a prism into the colors of the optical spectrum .
The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to ( can be detected by ) the human eye .
Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light .
A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm .
In terms of frequency , this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–790 THz .
A light-adapted eye generally has its maximum sensitivity at around 555 nm ( 540 THz ) , in the green region of the optical spectrum ( see : luminosity function ) .
The spectrum does not , however , contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguish .
Unsaturated colors such as pink , or purple variations such as magenta , are absent , for example , because they can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths .
Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors .
Visible wavelengths pass through the `` optical window `` , the region of the electromagnetic spectrum which allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earth 's atmosphere .
An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths , and so the midday sky appears blue .
The optical window is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum .
The near infrared ( NIR ) window lies just out of the human vision , as well as the Medium Wavelength IR ( MWIR ) window and the Long Wavelength or Far Infrared ( LWIR or FIR ) window though other animals may experience them .
Many species can see light with frequencies outside the `` visible spectrum , '' which is defined in terms of human vision .
Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light , which helps them find nectar in flowers .
Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light , rather than how colorful they appear to humans .
Birds , too , can see into the ultraviolet ( 300–400 nm ) , and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range .
Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range , however , can not see red light or any other reddish wavelengths .
Bees ' visible spectrum ends at about 590nm , just before the orange wavelengths start .
Birds , however , can see some red wavelengths , but not as many as humans .
how big are baby zebras when born
Zebras ( or ) are several species of African equids ( horse family ) united by their distinctive black and white stripes .
Their stripes come in different patterns , unique to each individual .
They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds .
Unlike their closest relatives , horses and asses , zebras have never been truly domesticated .
There are three species of zebras : the plains zebra , the Grévy 's zebra and the mountain zebra .
The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris , but Grévy 's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus .
The latter resembles an ass , to which it is closely related , while the former two are more horse-like .
All three belong to the genus Equus , along with other living equids .
The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people .
They occur in a variety of habitats , such as grasslands , savannas , woodlands , thorny scrublands , mountains , and coastal hills .
However , various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations , in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction .
Grévy 's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered .
While plains zebras are much more plentiful , one subspecies , the quagga , became extinct in the late 19th century – though there is currently a plan , called the Quagga Project , that aims to breed zebras that are phenotypically similar to the quagga in a process called breeding back .
How did Barry White die ?

how can plant gases slow erosion
A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz , Jordan
Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth 's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow , and then transported and deposited in other locations .
While erosion is a natural process , human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally .
Excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification , decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation , sedimentation of waterways , and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers .
Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined , they are responsible for 84 % of degraded acreage , making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems .
Industrial agriculture , deforestation , roads , anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion .
However , there are many available alternative land use practices that can curtail or limit erosion , such as terrace -building , no-till agriculture , and revegetation of denuded soils .

how old were the twin towers when destroyed
The World Trade Center is a complex of buildings under construction in Lower Manhattan , New York City , United States , replacing an earlier complex of seven buildings with the same name on the same site .
The original World Trade Center featured landmark twin towers , which opened on April 4 , 1973 and were destroyed in the September 11 attacks of 2001 , along with 7 World Trade Center .
The other buildings in the complex were damaged in the attacks , and their ruins were eventually demolished .
The site is being rebuilt with five new skyscrapers and a memorial to those killed in the attacks .
, only one skyscraper has been completed ; the other four are expected to be completed before 2020 .
One World Trade Center will be the lead building for the new complex , reaching more than 100 stories at its completion .
It became the tallest building in New York City on April 30 , 2012 , and is expected to be finished by 2013 .
A sixth tower is awaiting confirmation .
At the time of their completion , the original 1 World Trade Center ( the North Tower ) and 2 World Trade Center ( the South Tower ) , known collectively as the `` Twin Towers '' , were the tallest buildings in the world .
The other buildings included 3 WTC ( the Marriott World Trade Center ) , 4 WTC , 5 WTC , 6 WTC , and 7 WTC .
All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985 .
The cost for the construction was $ 400 million ( $ in dollars ) .
The complex was located in the heart of New York City 's downtown financial district and contained 13.4 million square feet ( 1.24 million m2 ) of office space .
The World Trade Center experienced a fire on , 1975 , a bombing on , 1993 and a robbery on , 1998 .
In 1998 , the Port Authority decided to privatize the World Trade Center , leasing the buildings to a private company to manage , and awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in .
On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , Al-Qaeda -affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex , one into each tower , in a coordinated terrorist attack .
After burning for 56 minutes , the South Tower ( 2 ) collapsed , followed a half-hour later by the North Tower ( 1 ) , with the attacks on the World Trade Center resulting in 2,753 deaths .
Falling debris from the towers , combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings , led to the partial or complete collapse of all the other buildings in the complex and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area .
The process of cleanup and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months .
Over the following years , plans for a rebuilt World Trade Center took form .
The first new building at the site was 7 World Trade Center , which opened in .
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation ( LMDC ) , established in to oversee the rebuilding process , organized competitions to select a site plan and memorial design .
Memory Foundations , designed by Daniel Libeskind , was selected as the master plan , but this went through substantial changes in design .
The new World Trade Center complex will include One World Trade Center , three other high-rise office towers , and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum .
how are transverse ranges formed
San Gabriel Mountains
San Bernardino Mountains , with Mt . San Gorgonio in the foreground and Big Bear Lake in the background .
The Transverse Ranges are a group of mountain ranges of southern California , in the Pacific Coast Ranges physiographic region in North America .
The Transverse Ranges begin at the southern end of the California Coast Ranges and lie between Santa Barbara and San Diego counties .
They derive the name Transverse Ranges due to their East-West orientation , making them transverse to the general North-South orientation of most of California 's coastal mountains .
how are the # of electrons in each shell determined
Periodic table with electron shells
An electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom 's nucleus .
The closest shell to the nucleus is called the `` 1 shell '' ( also called `` K shell '' ) , followed by the `` 2 shell '' ( or `` L shell '' ) , then the `` 3 shell '' ( or `` M shell '' ) , and so on farther and farther from the nucleus .
The shell letters K , L , M , ... , used in the X-ray notation , are alphabetical .
Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons : The 1st shell can hold up to two electrons , the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons , the 3rd shell can hold up to 18 , and 4th shell can hold up to 32 and so on .
Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus , an atom 's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons .
However , this is not a strict requirement : Atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells .
( See Madelung rule for more details . )
For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration .
The electrons in the outermost occupied shell ( or shells ) determine the chemical properties of the atom ; it is called the valence shell .
Each shell consists of one or more subshells , and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals .
how old was anna nicole smith when she meet her old husband

how many presidents of the us
The White House , the president 's official residence and center of the administration
Under the United States Constitution , the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
As chief of the executive branch and head of the federal government as a whole , the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition .
The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College ( or by the House of Representatives should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person ) .
Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951 , no person may be elected President more than twice , and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once .
Upon the death , resignation , or removal from office of an incumbent President , the Vice President assumes the office .
The President must be at least 35 years of age and a `` natural born '' citizen of the United States .
This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution , which took effect on March 4 , 1789 .
For American leaders before this ratification , see President of the Continental Congress .
The list does not include any Acting Presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution .
There have been 43 people sworn into office , and 44 presidencies , as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president .
Of the individuals elected as president , four died in office of natural causes ( William Henry Harrison , Zachary Taylor , Warren G. Harding , and Franklin D. Roosevelt ) , four were assassinated ( Abraham Lincoln , James A. Garfield , William McKinley , and John F. Kennedy ) and one resigned ( Richard Nixon ) .
George Washington , the first president , was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College .
William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841 , and Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years , but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945 .
He is the only president to serve more than two terms , and a constitutional amendment , affecting presidents after Harry Truman , was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president .
Andrew Jackson , the seventh president , was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed .
Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920 .
History records four presidents – John Q Adams , Rutherford B. Hayes , Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – who lost the popular vote but assumed office .
John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith , and the current president , Barack Obama , is the first president of African descent .
how a silencer works
Several firearms with detachable suppressors , from top to bottom : An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical , A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito .
Bolt action rimfire rifle with suppressor
AWM-F sniper rifle with attached suppressor .
A suppressor , sound suppressor , or sound moderator , is a device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm which reduces the amount of noise , and usually the amount of muzzle flash , generated by firing the weapon .
A suppressor can be used both with a firearm and with compressed air gun .
Though it is sometimes referred to as a silencer , this term is a misnomer popularized by cinematic fiction : the sound of a projectile , especially one moving faster than the speed of sound , through the air can not be eliminated .
Using a suppressor in long distance shooting ( i.e . greater than 300 meters ) can lessen , or retard , the report at the moment of impact , and create the impression of silence near the target .
The noise heard near the muzzle as a projectile leaves the barrel , though subdued , is not silent at all .
A suppressor is usually a metal cylinder with internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet .
Early suppressors were created around the beginning of the 20th century by several inventors .
American inventor Hiram Percy Maxim ( not to be confused with Hiram Stevens Maxim , Hiram Percy 's father , and the inventor of the Maxim Machine Gun ) , is credited with inventing and selling the first commercially successful models circa 1902 ( patented 30 March 1909 ) .
Maxim gave his device the trademarked name Maxim Silencer .
The muffler for internal combustion engines was developed in parallel with the firearm suppressor by Maxim in the early 20th century , using many of the same techniques to provide quieter-running engines ( in many European countries automobile mufflers are still called silencers ) .
The word silencer in reference to gun suppressor remains in widespread use , although it has since fallen out of favor with some , especially among the firearms industry , being replaced with the more literally accurate term sound suppressor or just suppressor , because a `` sound suppressor '' does not `` silence '' any weapon , rather it eliminates muzzle flash and reduces the sonic pressure of a firearm discharging .
Common usage and U.S. legislative language favor the historically earlier term , silencer .
In U.S. law , the terms `` firearm muffler '' and `` firearm silencer '' are synonymous .
Suppressors were regularly used by agents of the United States Office of Strategic Services , who favored the newly designed High Standard HDM .22 Long Rifle pistol during World War II .
OSS Director William Joseph `` Wild Bill '' Donovan demonstrated the pistol for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House .
According to OSS research chief Stanley Lovell , Donovan ( an old and trusted friend of the President ) was waved into the Oval Office , where Roosevelt was dictating a letter .
While Roosevelt finished his message , Donovan turned his back and fired ten shots into a sandbag he had brought with him , announced what he had done and handed the smoking gun to the astonished president .
The British SOE ( Special Operations Executive ) Welrod assassination pistol with an integral suppressor was also used by the American OSS on clandestine operations in Nazi occupied Europe during the Second World War .

how can hoa collect unpaid fees on property
For a discussion of nonprofit , voluntary neighborhood advocacy groups , see neighborhood association .
In the United States , a homeowner association is a corporation formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing , managing , and selling of homes and lots in a residential subdivision .
It grants the developer privileged voting rights in governing the association , while allowing the developer to exit financial and legal responsibility of the organization , typically by transferring ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling off a predetermined number of lots .
Membership in the homeowners association by a residential buyer is typically a condition of purchase ; a buyer is n't given an option to reject it .
Most homeowner associations are incorporated , and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations .
State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal , and mainly takes the form of laws which are inconsistent from state to state .
Some states , such as Florida and California , have a large body of homeowner association law , and some states , such as Massachusetts , have virtually no homeowner association law .
The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is common-interest developments ( CIDs ) , a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes , condominiums , and cooperative apartments .
Since 1964 , homeowner associations have become increasingly common in the USA .
The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents in 2010 .
how big can texel guinea pigs become
A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie
There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca . 5000 BC .
Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose , ranging from show breeds with long , flowing hair to those in use as model organisms by science .
From ca . 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532 , selective breeding by indigenous South American peoples resulted in many varieties of domestic Guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds .
Early Andean breeds were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food , and efforts at improving the Guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era .
With the export of Guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century , the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets .
To this end , various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers .
The American Cavy Breeders Association , an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association , is the governing body in the United States and Canada .
The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom .
Similar organizations exist in Australia ( Australian National Cavy Council ) and New Zealand ( New Zealand Cavy Club ) .
Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing .
New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century .
Though there are many breeds of Guinea pig , only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets .
Most Guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection .
The short hair , Abyssinian , Peruvian and Sheltie ( aka Silkie ) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets , and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of Guinea pigs .
In addition to their standard form , nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant .
Satins , due to their hollow hair shafts , possess coats of a special gloss and shine .
However , there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the Satin coat also can cause severe bone problems , including Osteodystrophy and Paget 's disease .
Showing Satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders ' associations because of animal welfare reasons .
All cavy breeds have some shared general standards : the head profile should be rounded , with large eyes and large , smooth ears .
The body should be strong and of compact build .
Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip .
These standards are best met by long established , commonly bred breeds , as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities .
The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds , which have had well established , separate breeding lines for different colours .
how are public schools funded
State schools ( also known as public schools or government schools ) generally refer to primary or secondary schools mandated for or offered to all children without charge paid for , in whole or in part , by taxation .
The term may also refer to institutions of post-secondary education funded , in whole or in part , and overseen by government .
how are ribosomes made
The ribosome assembles polymeric protein molecules whose sequence is controlled by the sequence of messenger RNA molecules .
This is required by all living cells and associated viruses .
The ribosome ( from ribonucleic acid and the Greek soma , meaning `` body '' ) is a large and complex molecular machine , found within all living cells , that serves as the primary site of biological protein synthesis ( translation ) .
Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules .
Ribosomes consist of two major subunits—the small ribosomal subunit reads the mRNA , while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain .
Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) molecules and a variety of proteins .
The sequence of DNA encoding for a protein may be copied many times into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) chains of a similar sequence .
Ribosomes can bind to an mRNA chain and use it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular protein .
Amino acids are selected , collected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA ( tRNA molecules ) , which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain .
The attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome .
Once the protein is produced , it can then 'fold ' to produce a specific functional three-dimensional structure .
A ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein .
Each ribosome is divided into two subunits : the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern , while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA and the amino acids .
When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule , these two subunits split apart .
Ribosomes are ribozymes , because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA .
Ribosomes from bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes ( the three domains of life on Earth ) differ in their size , sequence , structure , and the ratio of protein to RNA .
The differences in structure allow some antibiotics to kill bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes , while leaving human ribosomes unaffected .
In bacteria and archaea , more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time , each `` reading '' its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule .
The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria , reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria .
Albert Claude , Christian de Duve , and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , in 1974 , for the discovery of the ribosomes .
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for determining the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome .
what happens to the light independent reactions of photosynthesis ?
The simplified internal structure of a chloroplast
Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose .
These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes .
These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them .
There are three phases to the light-independent reactions , collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation , reduction reactions , and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration .
Despite its name , this process occurs only when light is available .
Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night .
They , instead , release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves .
This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work .
How Do You Find the mean of the squares of the first 10 counting numbers
In mathematics , a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer ; in other words , it is the product of some integer with itself .
For example , 9 is a square number , since it can be written as .
The usual notation for the formula for the square of a number is not the product , but the equivalent exponentiation , usually pronounced as `` squared '' .
The name square number comes from the name of the shape ; see below .
Square numbers are non-negative .
Another way of saying that a ( non-negative ) number is a square number , is that its square roots are again integers .
For example , = ±3 , so 9 is a square number .
A positive integer that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square-free .
For a non-negative integer , the th square number is , with being the zeroth square .
The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems .
If rational numbers are included , then a square is the ratio of two square integers , and , conversely , the ratio of two square integers is a square ( e.g. , 4/9 = ( 2/3 ) 2 ) .
Starting with 1 , there are square numbers up to and including , where the expression represents the floor of the number .
what ended the era of good feelings
The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars .
The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican party during the First Party System .
President James Monroe endeavored to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations , with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating parties altogether from national politics .
The period is so closely associated with Monroe 's presidency ( 1817–1825 ) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous .
The Era of Good Feelings marked a transition in American politics with the end of the Federalist Party as America began to develop after the War of 1812 .
While America was experiencing growth and prosperity after the war with Britain , this era also marks the first instance of economic troubles in the growing United States .
Mirroring the American System proposed by Henry Clay , protective tariffs and the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States complicated the tension between the North and South with the coming of the first financial crisis .
While the term “Era of Good Feelings” is usually viewed with irony because of the political turmoil , economic factors caused animosity between the North and South .
The designation of the period by historians as one of “good feelings” is often conveyed with irony or skepticism , as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive , especially among factions within the Monroe administration and the Republican Party .
The phrase “Era of Good Feelings” was coined by Benjamin Russell , in the Boston Federalist newspaper , Columbian Centinel , on July 12 , 1817 , following Monroe 's visit to Boston , Massachusetts as part of his good will tour of America .

how did the new york red bulls started in the mls
The New York Red Bulls is an American professional soccer team based in Harrison , New Jersey , representing the New York metropolitan area .
The team competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) .
It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS , having competed in the league since its inception .
The team was a founding member of MLS ( 1996 ) , but has gone through several name changes .
The team was originally known as the New York/New Jersey MetroStars through 1997 .
From the 1998 season through the 2005 season , the team was known as the MetroStars .
On March 9 , 2006 , the team was sold to Red Bull GmbH , leading to the team 's current name .
They are the only original MLS franchise not to have won any significant trophy ( including regular season , playoffs , and knockout competition ) since inception .
The team 's best result in the MLS was the MLS Cup final in 2008 .
In the US Open Cup , the MetroStars reached three semifinals ( 1997 , 1998 , 2000 ) , before reaching their first final in 2003 , losing 1–0 to the Chicago Fire .
On August 26 , 2000 , the Metros ' Clint Mathis set an MLS record by scoring five goals in a game against the Dallas Burn .
Some well-known players that have played for the team include Giovanni Savarese , Tim Howard , Tony Meola , Tab Ramos , Alexi Lalas , Clint Mathis , Jozy Altidore , Michael Bradley , Claudio Reyna , Eddie Pope , Roberto Donadoni , Lothar Matthäus , Adolfo Valencia , Youri Djorkaeff , Amado Guevara , Juan Pablo Ángel , Thierry Henry , Juninho Pernambucano , Jan Gunnar Solli , Rafael Márquez , and Tim Cahill .
The team has also had well-known coaches , including Carlos Queiroz , Carlos Alberto Parreira , Bora Milutinović , Bob Bradley , Mo Johnston , Bruce Arena and Hans Backe .
what countries are under the buddhism religion
Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism are one , a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream , 12th century , Song Dynasty .
Estimating the number of Buddhists in the world , or in many countries , is difficult due to definitional issues as well as practical problems of enumeration .
To begin with , the religious beliefs , practices , and identities of East Asians ( who comprise the majority of the world 's Buddhists by any measure ) often blend Buddhism with other traditions including Confucianism , the Chinese folk religion , Daoism , Shinto , and Korean shamanism .
Most followers of Buddhism do not belong to structured congregations , or observe a definite ritual of adherence such as taking Refuge , making it difficult to accurately estimate the number of practitioners .
An additional challenge is the hostility of several national governments ( often Communist ones such as China or North Korea ) to religion generally or to Buddhism specifically .
Government policies in these countries may encourage the under-reporting or non-reporting of religious adherence , resulting in official totals that may drastically underestimate the number of religious practitioners in these countries .
Estimate of the worldwide Buddhist population range from 350 million to over one billion , but cluster nearer to the first figure .
Adherents.com ( as of 2012 ) suggests a figure of 397 million .
By major branches , the numbers are as follows:
( 1 ) Mahayana Buddhism , including East Asian Buddhism , with no fewer than 185 million adherents , and possibly several times that many ( again , depending on definitional issues ) .
This is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in China , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Singapore , and Vietnam .
( 2 ) Theravada Buddhism , with no fewer than 125 million adherents .
This is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia , Thailand , Laos , Sri Lanka , and Burma .
( 3 ) Vajrayana Buddhism , with approximately 20 million adherents .
This form predominates in the greater Tibetan and Mongolian regions , as well as in the Himalayas .
Besides the independent countries of Mongolia and Bhutan , and various territories within what is now western China , Vajrayana is traditional to certain regions of Russia ( e.g . Kalmykia , Buryatia ) , India ( e.g . Ladakh , Sikkim ) , and Nepal ( e.g . Khumbu ) .
Vajrayana , also known as Tibetan Buddhism , is often conflated with Tantric Buddhism , but this is imprecise , as Shingon and other forms of East Asian Buddhism also practice tantra .
At least 7 countries ( Sri Lanka , Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Bhutan , and Mongolia ) have unambiguous Buddhist majorities .
Depending on how one calculates Chinese and other East Asian adherents , this figure might expand to include several more countries .
In addition , Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia and Bhutan , and receives prominent mention in the constitutions of Thailand and Sri Lanka .
In northern India and Nepal , the land where Buddhism was born , the religion severely declined during the first millennium .
Whether this decline was due to the Islamic conquest of northern India , or to other factors , remains controversial .
See the article Decline of Buddhism in India .
how did wild bill 's father die
James Butler Hickok ( May 27 , 1837 – August 2 , 1876 ) , better known as Wild Bill Hickok , was a folk hero of the American Old West .
His skills as a gunfighter and scout , along with his reputation as a lawman , provided the basis for his fame , although some of his reported exploits are fictionalized .
Born and raised on a farm in rural Illinois , Hickok went west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice , first working as a stagecoach driver , before he became a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska .
He fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War , and gained publicity after the war as a scout , marksman , actor , and professional gambler .
Between his law-enforcement duties and gambling , which easily overlapped , Hickok was involved in several notable shootouts .
He was shot and killed while playing poker in the Nuttal & Mann 's Saloon in Deadwood , Dakota Territory ( now South Dakota ) .
how many land rovers have landed on mars
Artist 's conception of the Curiosity rover vaporizing rock on Mars .
The rover landed on Mars in August 2012 .
A Mars rover is an automated motor vehicle which propels itself across the surface of the planet Mars after landing .
Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers : they examine more territory , they can be directed to interesting features , they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control .
There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Mars Pathfinder mission and its now inactive Sojourner rover .
It currently manages the Mars Exploration Rover mission 's active Opportunity rover and inactive Spirit , and , as part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission , the Curiosity rover .
how do forensic auditors examine financial reporting
A financial audit , or more accurately , an audit of financial statements , is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity , with a view to express an audit opinion .
The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance , but not absolute assurance , that the financial statements are presented fairly , in all material respects , and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework .
The purpose of an audit is provide and objective independent examination of the financial statements , which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management , thus increase user confidence in the financial statement , reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements .
Financial audits are typically performed by firms of practicing accountants who are experts in financial reporting .
The financial audit is one of many assurance functions provided by accounting firms .
Many organizations separately employ or hire internal auditors , who do not attest to financial reports but focus mainly on the internal controls of the organization .
External auditors may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors .
Auditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization , therefore would likely to reduce of such corporations to conceal unscrupulous dealings .
Internationally , the International Standards on Auditing ( ISA ) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ( IAASB ) is considered as the benchmark for audit process .
Almost all jurisdictions require auditors to follow the ISA or a local variation of the ISA .
what does a silver dollar 1873 coin look like
Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold , silver , and base metal versions .
The term silver dollar is often used for any large white metal coin issued by the United States with a face value of one dollar , although purists insist that a dollar is not silver unless it contains some of that metal .
Silver dollars , the first dollar coin issue , were minted beginning in 1794 .
Gold dollars and gold-colored dollars have also been produced by the United States .
The Sacagawea and Presidential dollars are often referred to as `` golden dollars '' .
In modern times , dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States .
Despite efforts by the government to promote their use , most Americans currently use the one dollar bill rather than dollar coins .
how fast is one g
In straight and level flight lift ( L ) equals weight ( W ) .
In a banked turn of 60° , lift equals double the weight ( L=2W ) .
The pilot experiences 2g and a doubled weight .
The steeper the bank , the greater the g-forces .
This top-fuel dragster can accelerate from zero to in 0.86 seconds .
This is a horizontal acceleration of 5.3 g. Combined with the vertical g-force in the stationary case the Pythagorean theorem yields a g force of 5.4 g .
g-force ( with g from gravitational ) is a term for accelerations felt as weight and measurable by accelerometers .
It is not a force , per se , but a force per unit mass .
Since such a force is perceived as a weight , any g-force can be described as a `` weight per unit mass '' ( see the synonym specific weight ) .
The g-force acceleration acts as a multiplier of weight-like forces for every unit of an object 's mass , and ( save for certain electromagnetic force influences ) is the cause of an object 's acceleration in relation to free-fall .
This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of non-gravitational forces acting on an object free to move .
The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations , and it is only these that are measured in g-force units .
They cause stresses and strains on objects .
Because of these strains , large g-forces may be destructive .
Gravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force , even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity .
Thus , the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth 's surface produces g-force only indirectly , as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces .
The 1 g-force on an object sitting on the Earth 's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground , keeping the object from going into free-fall .
The upward force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth 's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition , which is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth 's center .
Objects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation-only , feel no g-force .
This is demonstrated by the `` zero-g '' conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth 's center ( in vacuum ) , or ( to good approximation ) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit .
These are examples of coordinate acceleration ( a change in velocity ) without a sensation of weight .
The experience of no g-force ( zero-g ) , however it is produced , is synonymous with weightlessness .
In the absence of gravitational fields , or in directions at right angles to them , proper and coordinate accelerations are the same , and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration .
An example here is a rocket in free space , in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines , and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers .
What did the augurs use to interpret the will of the gods ?
An augur holding a lituus , the curved wand often used as a symbol of augury on Roman coins
The augur was a priest and official in the classical world , especially ancient Rome and Etruria .
His main role was to interpret the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds : whether they are flying in groups or alone , what noises they make as they fly , direction of flight and what kind of birds they are .
This was known as `` taking the auspices . ''
The ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society—public or private—including matters of war , commerce , and religion .
The Roman historian Livy stresses the importance of the augurs : `` Who does not know that this city was founded only after taking the auspices , that everything in war and in peace , at home and abroad , was done only after taking the auspices ? ''
What county is Farmington Hills , MI in ?

how were letters sealed in the 1800s
Present-day impression of a Late Bronze Age seal
Town seal ( matrix ) of Náchod from 1570
A seal is a device for making an impression in wax , clay , paper , or some other medium , including an embossment on paper , and is also the impression thus made .
The original purpose was to authenticate a document , a wrapper for one such as a modern envelope , or the cover of a container or package holding valuables or other objects .
The sealing process is essentially that of a mould , with the final image represented on the device for making the impression by a mirror-image design , incised in sunken- ( or counter- ) relief or intaglio .
The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die ; the imprint it creates as the seal impression ( or , more rarely , the sealing ) .
If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch , the seal is known as a dry seal ; in all other cases a liquid or liquified medium ( such as ink or wax ) is used , usually in another color than the paper .
For legal purposes , the definition of a seal may be extended to include rubber stamps , or writing specified words ( `` seal '' or `` L.S . `` ) .
In the United States , the word `` seal '' is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design ( in monochrome or color ) , which may be used in a variety of contexts including architectural settings , on flags , or on official letterheads .
Thus , for example , the Great Seal of the United States , among other uses , appears on the reverse of the one-dollar bill ; and several of the seals of the U.S. states appear on their respective state flags .
In Europe , although coats of arms and heraldic badges may well feature in such contexts as well as on seals , the seal design in its entirety rarely appears as an emblem .
The study of seals is known as sigillography or sphragistics .
what does a groundhog look for on groundhog day
Groundhog Day ( Pennsylvania German : Grundsaudaag , Murmeltiertag ) is a day celebrated on February 2 .
According to folklore , if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day , then spring will come early ; if it is sunny , the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow , and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks .
Modern customs of the holiday involve celebrations where early morning festivals are held to watch the groundhog emerging from its burrow .
In southeastern Pennsylvania , Groundhog Lodges ( Grundsow Lodges ) celebrate the holiday with fersommlinge , social events in which food is served , speeches are made , and one or more g'spiel ( plays or skits ) are performed for entertainment .
The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event , and those who speak English pay a penalty , usually in the form of a nickel , dime , or quarter per word spoken , with the money put into a bowl in the center of the table .
The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney , Pennsylvania .
Groundhog Day , already a widely recognized and popular tradition , received widespread attention as a result of the 1993 film Groundhog Day , which was set in Punxsutawney , PA ( though filmed primarily in Woodstock , IL ) and portrayed Punxsutawney Phil .
how is the weather in tampa
High resolution image of Tampa Bay region
The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate ( Koppen Cfa ) , with warm and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and drier winters with freezing temperatures occurring every 2–3 years .
The area experiences a significant summer wet season , as nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September .
The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) as being in hardiness zone 10 , which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown .
Highs usually range between 65 and 95 °F ( 18 and 35 °C ) year round .
Though known for hot summers , Tampa 's official high has never reached 100 °F ( 38 °C ) – the city 's all-time record temperature is 99 °F ( 37 °C ) .
St. Petersburg 's all-time record high is exactly 100 °F ( 38 °C ) .
Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay .
This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere .
In general , the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges , both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year .
What generates gamma radiation
A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum , showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation .
The `` electromagnetic spectrum '' of an object has a different meaning , and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object .
The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength ( high-frequency ) end , thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom .
The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself , while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length , although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous .
Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions , as ways to study and characterize matter .
In addition , radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing ( see electromagnetic radiation for more applications ) .
Legend
how many presidential terms did fdr serve
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( or ; January 30 , 1882 – April 12 , 1945 ) , also known by his initials , FDR , was the 32nd President of the United States ( 1933–1945 ) and a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century , leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war .
A dominant leader of the Democratic Party and the only American president elected to more than two terms , he built a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932 , as his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century .
With the bouncy popular song `` Happy Days Are Here Again `` as his campaign theme , FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932 , at the depth of the Great Depression .
Energized by his personal victory over polio , FDR 's unfailing optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit .
He worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II , and restoring prosperity to the nation 's economy .
In his first hundred days in office , which began March 4 , 1933 , Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal —a variety of programs designed to produce relief ( government jobs for the unemployed ) , recovery ( economic growth ) , and reform ( through regulation of Wall Street , banks and transportation ) .
The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , but then relapsed into a deep recession .
The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court or passing any considerable legislation ; it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment diminished during World War II .
Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85 , except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which still exists .
Along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which was created in 1933 , and Social Security , which Congress passed in 1935 .
As World War II loomed after 1938 , with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain , while remaining officially neutral .
His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` which would supply munitions to the Allies .
In March 1941 , Roosevelt , with Congressional approval , provided Lend-Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain .
With very strong national support , he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , calling it a `` date which will live in infamy `` .
He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the Allied war effort .
As an active military leader , Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world 's first atom bomb .
In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians .
Unemployment dropped to 2 % , relief programs largely ended , and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers , and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service .
Roosevelt dominated the American political scene not only during the twelve years of his presidency , but also for decades afterward .
He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System .
FDR 's New Deal Coalition united labor unions , big city machines , white ethnics , African Americans and rural white Southerners .
He also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods .
Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents , along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington .
A liberal Democrat , Roosevelt defined his ideological position as `` a little left of center . ''
What committees are joint committees
A Joint Committee is a term in politics that is used to refer to a committee made up of members of both chambers of a bicameral legislature .
In other contexts , it refers to a committee with members from more than one organization .
HOW MANY BROTHELS WERE THERE IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1840 'S
The regulation of prostitution in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government ; Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit , prohibit , or otherwise regulate commercial sex , except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws like the Mann Act .
In most states , prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime , a crime that disrupts the order of a community .
It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime .
Currently , Nevada is the only state to allow brothel prostitution , the terms of which are stipulated in the Nevada Revised Statutes .
Only 8 counties currently contain active brothels .
All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County ( which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area ) , Washoe County ( which contains Reno ) , Carson City , Douglas County , and Lincoln County .
The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution , but some of these counties currently have no active brothels .
Street prostitution , `` pandering , '' and living off of the proceeds of a prostitute remain illegal under Nevada law , as elsewhere in the country .
As with other countries , prostitution in the United States can be divided into three broad categories : street prostitution , brothel prostitution , and escort prostitution .
how many stripes on the flag
The national flag of the United States of America , often simply referred to as the American flag , consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red ( top and bottom ) alternating with white , with a blue rectangle in the canton ( referred to specifically as the `` union '' ) bearing fifty small , white , five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars ( top and bottom ) alternating with rows of five stars .
The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and became the first states in the Union .
Nicknames for the flag include the `` Stars and Stripes '' , `` Old Glory `` , and `` The Star-Spangled Banner . ''
How many states and territories are within India ?
India is a federal union of states comprising twenty-eight states and seven union territories .
The states and territories are further subdivided into districts and so on .
what congressional district am i in
Congressional districts for the 113th United States Congress
2010 Census change:
Change in apportionment of congressional districts , starting in 2013 , as a result of the 2010 census .
2000 Census change:
Change in apportionment of congressional districts , from 2003 to 2013 , as a result of the 2000 census .
This is a complete list of congressional districts for representation in the United States House of Representatives .
The quantity ( apportionment ) and boundaries ( redistricting ) of districts are determined after each census , although in some cases states have changed the boundaries more than once per census .
This list includes the 435 current and over 200 obsolete districts .
For example , since the 2000 census , Nebraska has had three districts , but it used to have as many as six .
In the first decade of the twenty-first century , Texas had 32 districts , but has since added four due to reapportionment as a result of the 2010 census .
Other states have lost districts since the number of congressional seats has been set at 435 by statute .
Also included here are non-voting delegations : six current and four obsolete .
The boundaries of districts often shift with each redistricting .
Over time , the region and demographics represented in a district can change substantially .
Furthermore , districts sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers .
how many people have mariah carey dated ?
Mariah Carey ( born March 27 , 1970 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer , actress , and philanthropist .
Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola , Carey released her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990 ; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 chart .
Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993 and success with hit records Emotions ( 1991 ) , Music Box ( 1993 ) , and Merry Christmas ( 1994 ) , Carey was established as Columbia 's highest-selling act .

how much does cloud 10 cost wikipedia
Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus
In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body .
These suspended particles are also known as aerosols .
Clouds in Earth 's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology .
Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated ; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air .
In general , precipitation will fall to the surface ; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface .
The international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous wisps , as in the case of cirrus .
Prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges .
These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers , cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds , nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation , alto- for middle clouds , and cirro- for high clouds ; the latter two of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure .
Whether or not a cloud is low , middle , or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms .
Cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air .
Clouds in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system , which began to spread in popularity during December 1802 .
Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds .
While a majority of clouds form in Earth 's troposphere , there are occasions when clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed .
These three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere .
Above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere , which together make up the heterosphere that marks the transition to outer space .
Clouds have been observed on other planets and moons within the Solar System , but , due to their different temperature characteristics , they are composed of other substances such as methane , ammonia , and sulfuric acid .

how many schools are in the big ten
The Big Ten Conference , formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference , is the oldest Division I college athletic conference in the United States .
Its twelve member institutions ( which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective states , well-regarded academically , and with relatively large student enrollment ) are located primarily in the Midwest , stretching from Nebraska in the west to Penn State in the east .
The conference competes in the NCAA 's Division I ; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , formerly known as Division I-A , the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport .
Member schools of the Big Ten ( or , in two cases , their parent university systems ) also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation , a leading educational and research consortium .
Despite the conference 's name , the Big Ten actually consists of 12 schools , following the addition of The Pennsylvania State University in 1993 and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2011 .
In 2014 , the conference will expand to 14 members with the additions of the University of Maryland , College Park and Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey .
It is not to be confused with the Big 12 Conference , which has only ten schools and represents a different region of the country .
how is single malt scotch made
Single Malt Scotch is single malt whisky made in Scotland using a pot still distillation process at a single distillery , with malted barley as the only grain ingredient .
As with any Scotch whisky , a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years ( most single malts are matured longer ) .
`` Malt '' indicates that the whisky is distilled from a `` malted '' grain .
Several types of grains can be malted ( for example , barley , rye and wheat are all grains which can be malted ) ; however , in the case of single malt Scotch , barley is always the only grain used .
`` Single '' indicates that all the malts in the bottle come from a single distillery .
Bottlings containing malt whisky from multiple distilleries are called `` blended malt `` .
Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 ( SWR 2009 ) , the word `` blended '' only appeared ( in the context of Scotch whisky ) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky , but this is no longer the case .
Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009 , a `` blended malt Scotch whisky '' is a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies , not a mixture of malted barley whisky and non-barley whisky ; those are called `` blended Scotch whisky '' , without the word `` malt '' .
The term `` blended malt '' replaced `` vatted malt '' used under the prior labelling conventions .
The age statement on a bottle of single malt Scotch is the number of years the whisky spent maturing in cask .
As very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask the age statement reflects the age of the youngest malt in the mix .
what composer used sound mass
A texture may be arranged so as to , `` closely approach the single-object status of fused-ensemble timbres , for example , the beautiful 'northern lights ' chord ... , in a very interesting distribution of pitches , produces a fused sound supported by a suspended cymbal roll `` ( Erickson ( 1975 ) , p.166 & 168 ) .
In contrast to more traditional musical textures , sound mass composition `` minimizes the importance of individual pitches in preference for texture , timbre , and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact . ''
Developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the late 1950s and 1960s , sound-mass `` obscures the boundary between sound and noise `` ( Edwards 2001 , pp . 326–27 ) .
Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings , flutter tonguing , wide vibrato , extreme ranges , and glissandos .
Composers and works include Barbara Kolb , Pauline Oliveros ' Sound Patterns for chorus ( 1961 ) , Norma Beecroft 's From Dreams of Brass for chorus ( 1963–1964 ) , and Nancy Van de Vate .
Beecroft `` blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters , choral speech , narrator , and a wash of sounds from an electronic tape . ''
( ibid )
A very early example is the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel 's ballet Les Elémens ( 1737–38 ) , where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale ( Henck 2004 , pp . 52–54 ) .
A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger 's String Quartet 1931 ( Nonesuch H-71280 ) while more recently Phill Niblock 's multiple drone based music serves as an example .
The use of `` chords approaching timbres '' begins with Debussy and Edgard Varèse often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass ( Erickson 1975 , pp . 18 and 21 ) .
Other examples include European `` textural '' compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki 's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima ( 1959 ) and György Ligeti 's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosphères ( 1961 ) and his Requiem ( 1963-65 ) .
Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk Górecki , Karel Husa , Witold Lutosławski , Kazimierz Serocki , and Steven Stucky .
Sound mass techniques also appear in the music of George Crumb ( Anon . n.d. ) .

what continent is australia
Australia is a continent comprising mainland Australia , Tasmania , New Guinea , Seram , possibly Timor , and neighbouring islands .
The continent is sometimes known in technical contexts by the names Sahul , Australinea or Meganesia , to distinguish it from the Australian mainland .
It is the smallest of the seven traditional continents in the English conception .
New Zealand is not part of the continent of Australia , but of the separate , submerged continent of Zealandia .
Zealandia and Australia are both part of the wider regions known as Australasia and Oceania .
The continent of Australia lies on a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses — the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea , and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania .
When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age , including the last glacial maximum about 18,000 BC , they were connected by dry land .
During the past ten thousand years , rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today 's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania .
Geologically , a continent extends to the edge of its continental shelf , so the now-separate islands are considered part of the continent .
Due to the spread of animals , fungi and plants across the single Pleistocene landmass the separate lands have a related biota .
how does rainfall in new york affect the environment ?
Central Park is nearly twice as big as the world 's second-smallest country , Monaco .
Historically its reservoirs were important components of the city 's water supply .

What did the hollywood blacklist have to do with McCarthy
A 1947 propaganda comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society raising the specter of a Communist takeover
McCarthyism is the practice of making accusations of disloyalty , subversion , or treason without proper regard for evidence .
It also means `` the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques , especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism . ''
The term has its origins in the period in the United States known as the Second Red Scare , lasting roughly from 1950 to 1956 and characterized by heightened fears of communist influence on American institutions and espionage by Soviet agents .
Originally coined to criticize the anti-communist pursuits of Republican U.S . Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin , `` McCarthyism '' soon took on a broader meaning , describing the excesses of similar efforts .
The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless , unsubstantiated accusations , as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries .
During the McCarthy era , thousands of Americans were accused of being Communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels , committees and agencies .
The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees , those in the entertainment industry , educators and union activists .
Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence , and the level of threat posed by a person 's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was often greatly exaggerated .
Many people suffered loss of employment and/or destruction of their careers ; some even suffered imprisonment .
Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned , laws that would be declared unconstitutional , dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable , or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute .
The most famous examples of McCarthyism include the speeches , investigations , and hearings of Senator McCarthy himself ; the Hollywood blacklist , associated with hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) ; and the various anti-communist activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) under Director J. Edgar Hoover .
McCarthyism was a widespread social and cultural phenomenon that affected all levels of society and was the source of a great deal of debate and conflict in the United States .

how many people died at the pentagon in 9 11
The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as September 11 , September 11th , or 9/11 ) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks launched by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States in New York City and the Washington , D.C. area on September 11 , 2001 .
Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks .
Two of those planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in New York City .
Within two hours , both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the WTC complex , as well as major damage to ten other large surrounding structures .
A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense ) , leading to a partial collapse in its western side .
The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was targeted at the United States Capitol in Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers .
In total , almost 3,000 people died in the attacks , including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes .
Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda .
Although the group 's leader , Osama bin Laden , initially denied any involvement , in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel , the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , and sanctions against Iraq as motives for the attacks .
The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had harbored al-Qaeda .
Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers .
Having evaded capture for years , bin Laden was located and killed by U.S. forces in May 2011 .
The destruction of the Twin Towers and other properties caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets .
Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002 , and the Pentagon was repaired within a year .
Numerous memorials have been constructed , including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York , the Pentagon Memorial , and the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania .
After a lengthy delay , the One World Trade Center is expected to be completed at Ground Zero in New York City in 2013 .
how many people visit crater lake national park each year
Crater Lake National Park is a United States National Park located in southern Oregon .
Established in 1902 , Crater Lake National Park is the fifth oldest national park in the United States and the only one in the state of Oregon .
The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake , a remnant of a destroyed volcano , Mount Mazama , and the surrounding hills and forests .
The lake is deep at its deepest point , which makes it the deepest lake in the United States , the second deepest in North America and the ninth deepest in the world .
Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh deepest lake in the world , but this former listing excludes the approximately depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica , which resides under nearly of ice , and the recent report of a maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins /San Martin , located on the border of Chile and Argentina .
However , when comparing its average depth of to the average depth of other deep lakes , Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third deepest in the world .
The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical deep caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range .
The caldera rim ranges in elevation from .
The United States Geological Survey benchmarked elevation of the lake surface itself is .
This National Park encompasses .
Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it .
All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage .
The lake 's water commonly has a striking blue hue , and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain .

what edition of book of mormon had 103 sections
The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement , which adherents believe contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421 .
It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon : An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi .
According to Smith 's account , and also according to the book 's narrative , the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as `` reformed Egyptian `` engraved on golden plates .
Smith claimed that the last prophet to contribute to the book , a man named Moroni , buried it in a hill in present-day New York and then returned to earth in 1827 as an angel , revealing the location of the book to Smith and instructing him to translate and disseminate it as evidence of the restoration of Christ 's true church in the latter days .
The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve , the nature of the Atonement , eschatology , redemption from physical and spiritual death , and the organization of the latter-day church .
The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ to the Americas shortly after his resurrection .
The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement , the denominations of which typically regard the text not only as scripture but also as a historical record of God 's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas .
The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books , titled after the individuals named as primary authors and , in most versions , divided into chapters and verses .
It is written in English , very similar to the Early Modern English linguistic style of the King James Version of the Bible , and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages .

What did movie theaters do for sound before synchronized sound was introduced into film
1908 poster advertising Gaumont 's sound films .
The Chronomégaphone , designed for large halls , employed compressed air to amplify the recorded sound .
A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound , or sound technologically coupled to image , as opposed to a silent film .
The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900 , but decades would pass before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical .
Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems , and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate .
Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology , which took place in 1923 .
The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid- to late 1920s .
At first , the sound films incorporating synchronized dialogue—known as `` talking pictures '' , or `` talkies '' —were exclusively shorts ; the earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects .
The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer , released in October 1927 .
A major hit , it was made with Vitaphone , the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology .
Sound-on-film , however , would soon become the standard for talking pictures .
By the early 1930s , the talkies were a global phenomenon .
In the United States , they helped secure Hollywood 's position as one of the world 's most powerful cultural/commercial systems ( see Cinema of the United States ) .
In Europe ( and , to a lesser degree , elsewhere ) the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics , who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema .
In Japan , where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance , talking pictures were slow to take root .
In India , sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation 's film industry—the most productive such industry in the world since the early 1960s .

The Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards ( commonly known as ARIA Music Awards or ARIA Awards ) is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry , put on by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) .
The event has been held annually since 1987 and encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards ( these are what is usually being referred to as `` the ARIA awards '' ) as well as Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards ( held separately from 2004 ) , Lifetime Achievement Awards and ARIA Hall of Fame – held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011 .
For 2010 , ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time .
Winning , or even being nominated for , an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention on an artist , and usually increases recording sales several-fold – in 2005 , for example , after Ben Lee won three awards , his album Awake Is the New Sleep jumped from No . 31 to No . 5 in the ARIA Charts , its highest position .
how many for profit colleges in the usa
For-profit education ( also known as the education services industry or proprietary education ) refers to educational institutions operated by private , profit -seeking businesses .
There are three types of for-profit schools .
One type is known as an educational management organization ( EMO ) , and these are primary and secondary educational institutions .
EMOs work with school districts or charter schools , using public funds to finance operations .
The majority of for-profit schools in the K–12 sector in America function as EMOs , and have grown in number in the mid-2000s .
The other major category of for-profit schools are post-secondary institutions which operate as businesses , receiving fees from each student they enroll .
A third type of for-profit schools , which is less prevalent in the United States , are K–12 schools which operate as businesses .
EMOs function differently from charter schools created in order to carry out a particular teaching pedagogy ; most charter schools are mission-oriented , while EMOs and other for-profit institutions are market-oriented .
While supporters argue that the profit motive encourages efficiency , this arrangement has also drawn controversy and criticism .
Kevin Carey , director of the education policy program of the New American Foundation said in a 2010 column in The Chronicle of Higher Education that `` For-profits exist in large part to fix educational market failures left by traditional institutions , and they profit by serving students that public and private nonprofit institutions too often ignore . ''
He also noted that `` There 's no doubt that the worst for-profits are ruthlessly exploiting the commodified college degree .
But they did n't commodify it in the first place . ''

how does a dredge work ?
A grab dredge
Dredging is an excavation activity or operation usually carried out at least partly underwater , in shallow seas or fresh water areas with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments and disposing of them at a different location .
This technique is often used to keep waterways navigable .
It is also used as a way to replenish sand on some public beaches , where sand has been lost because of coastal erosion .
Dredging is also used as a technique for fishing for certain species of edible clams and crabs , see fishing dredge .
A dredger ( or “dredge” as is the general usage in the Americas ) is any device , machine , or vessel that is used to excavate and remove material from the bottom of a body of water .
For example , a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up from the bottom of a pond is a dredger .
Developing this idea further , a motorized crane equipped with a drag bucket or clamshell ( grabber ) that is used to scoop material from the bottom of a body of water is also a dredger .
The crane could be located on the bank , or perhaps mounted on a barge .
If the crane is mounted on a barge , the entire vessel is referred to as a dredger .
The process of dredging creates spoils ( excess material ) , which are carried away from the dredged area .
Dredging can produce materials for land reclamation or other purposes ( usually construction-related ) , and has also historically played a significant role in gold mining .
Dredging can create disturbance in aquatic ecosystems , often with adverse impacts .
how do former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity
Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006 .
Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km during the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo , Philippines in 1991 .
A volcano is an opening , or rupture , in a planet 's surface or crust , which allows hot magma , volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface .
Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging .
A mid-oceanic ridge , for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart ; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together .
By contrast , volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .
Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth 's crust in the interiors of plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift , the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America .
This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of `` Plate hypothesis '' volcanism .
Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes .
These so-called `` hotspots `` , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth .
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards , not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption .
Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft , in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature .
Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth 's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however , they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth , thereby warming the stratosphere .
Historically , so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines .
what did benedict arnold die
Benedict Arnold ( June 14 , 1801 ) was a general during the American Revolutionary War who originally fought for the American Continental Army but defected to the British Army .
While a general on the American side , he obtained command of the fort at West Point , New York , and planned to surrender it to the British forces .
After the plan was exposed in September 1780 , he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general .
Born in Connecticut , Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775 .
After joining the growing army outside Boston , he distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery .
His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 , defensive and delaying tactics despite losing the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 , the Battle of Ridgefield , Connecticut ( after which he was promoted to major general ) , operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777 , in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years .
Despite Arnold 's successes , he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments .
Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance , but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries .
Congress investigated his accounts and found he was indebted to Congress after spending much of his own money on the war effort .
Frustrated and bitter , Arnold decided to change sides in 1779 , and opened secret negotiations with the British .
In July 1780 , he was offered , continued to pursue and was awarded command of West Point .
Arnold 's scheme to surrender the fort to the British was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers that revealed the plot .
Upon learning of André 's capture , Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture , narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington , who had been alerted to the plot .
Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army , an annual pension of £360 , and a lump sum of over £6,000 .
He led British forces on raids in Virginia , and against New London and Groton , Connecticut , before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown .
In the winter of 1782 , Arnold moved to London with his second wife , Margaret `` Peggy '' Shippen Arnold .
He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs .
In 1787 , he returned to the merchant business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John , New Brunswick .
He returned to London to settle permanently in 1791 , where he died ten years later .
Because of the way he changed sides , his name quickly became a in the United States for treason or betrayal .
His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor .
how many world series did curt schilling have
Curtis Montague Schilling ( born November 14 , 1966 ) is a former American Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher and Video Game developer .
He helped lead the Philadelphia Phillies to the World Series in and won World Series championships in with the Arizona Diamondbacks and in and with the Boston Red Sox .
Schilling retired with a career postseason record of 11–2 .
His .846 postseason winning percentage is a major-league record among pitchers with at least 10 decisions .
After retiring , he founded Green Monster Games which was renamed 38 Studios .
The company released Kingdoms of Amalur : Reckoning in February 2012 , but just three months later , Schilling laid off his entire staff amid severe financial troubles that resulted in the company missing payroll the previous week .
how many star wars movies are there
Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas .
The film series has spawned a media franchise outside the film series called the Expanded Universe including books , television series , computer and video games , and comic books .
These supplements to the film trilogies have resulted in significant development of the series ' fictional universe .
These media kept the franchise active in the interim between the film trilogies .
The franchise portrays a galaxy that is described as far , far away in the distant past .
It commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good , in conflict with the Sith , their evil counterpart .
Their weapon of choice , the lightsaber , is commonly recognized in popular culture .
The fictional universe also contains many themes , especially influences of philosophy and religion .
The first film in the series was originally released on May 25 , 1977 , under the title Star Wars , by 20th Century Fox , and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon , followed by two sequels , released at three-year intervals .
Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy 's final film , the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released .
The three prequel films were also released at three-year intervals , with the final film of the trilogy released on May 19 , 2005 .
In October 2012 , The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for $ 4.05 billion and announced that it would produce three new films , with the first film , Star Wars Episode VII , planned for release in 2015 .
20th Century Fox still retains the distribution rights to the first two Star Wars trilogies , owning permanent rights for the original film Episode IV : A New Hope , while holding the rights to Episodes I–III , V and VI until May 2020 .
Reactions to the original trilogy were mostly positive , with the last film being considered the weakest , while the prequel trilogy received a more mixed reaction , with most of the praise being for the final movie , according to most review aggregator websites .
All six of the main films in the series were also nominated for or won Academy Awards .
All of the main films have been box office successes , with the overall box office revenue generated by the Star Wars films ( including the theatrical Star Wars : The Clone Wars ) totalling $ 4.49 billion , making it the third-highest-grossing film series .
The success has also led to multiple re-releases in theaters for the series .
how much will a transfusion of platelet apheresis raise the platelet count
Plateletpheresis ( more accurately called thrombocytapheresis or thrombapheresis , though these names are rarely used ) is the process of collecting thrombocytes , more commonly called platelets , a component of blood involved in blood clotting .
The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets , which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor .
Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) or platelet dysfunction .
This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis .
how many ports are there in networking
In computer networking , a port is an application-specific or process-specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint in a computer 's host operating system .
A port is associated with an IP address of the host , as well as the type of protocol used for communication .
The purpose of ports is to uniquely identify different applications or processes running on a single computer and thereby enable them to share a single physical connection to a packet-switched network like the Internet .
The protocols that primarily use ports are the Transport Layer protocols , such as the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) of the Internet Protocol Suite .
A port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number , commonly known as the port number .
The port number , added to a computer 's IP address , completes the destination address for a communications session .
That is , data packets are routed across the network to a specific destination IP address , and then , upon reaching the destination computer , are further routed to the specific process bound to the destination port number .
Note that it is the combination of IP address and port number together that must be globally unique .
Thus , different IP addresses or protocols may use the same port number for communication ; e.g. , on a given host or interface UDP and TCP may use the same port number , or on a host with two interfaces , both addresses may be associated with a port having the same number .
Of the thousands of enumerated ports , about 250 well-known ports are reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host .
In the client-server model of application architecture , ports are used to provide a multiplexing service on each server-side port number that network clients connect to for service initiation , after which communication can be reestablished on other connection-specific port numbers .
what area code is 479
Area code 479 is the telephone area code serving thirteen counties in northwest Arkansas , including the cities of Fort Smith , Fayetteville , Springdale , Rogers and Bentonville : the second , third , fourth , eighth and tenth-largest cities in the state , respectively .
It was created in 2002 in a split from area code 501 .
Area code 479 serves Benton , Carroll ( split with area code 870 ) , Crawford , Franklin , Johnson , Logan , Madison , Polk , Pope , Scott , Sebastian , Washington and Yell Counties in Arkansas .
what does arraignment mean
Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her .
In response to arraignment , the accused is expected to enter a plea .
Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions , but they generally include `` guilty '' , `` not guilty '' , and the peremptory pleas ( or pleas in bar ) setting out reasons why a trial can not proceed .
Pleas of `` nolo contendere `` ( no contest ) and the `` Alford plea `` are allowed in some circumstances .
In England , Wales , Northern Ireland and Australia , arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial , and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment .
The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge .
In federal courts of the United States , arraignment takes place in two stages .
The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual 's arrest , 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday .
During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel .
The presiding judge also decides at what amount , if any , to set bail .
During the second arraignment , a post-indictment arraignment or PIA , the defendant is allowed to enter a plea .
what did chaucer do
Geoffrey Chaucer ( ; c. 1343 – 25 October 1400 ) , known as the Father of English literature , is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to have been buried in Poet 's Corner of Westminster Abbey .
While he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author , philosopher , alchemist and astronomer , composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for his ten year-old son Lewis , Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat , courtier and diplomat .
Among his many works , which include The Book of the Duchess , the House of Fame , the Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde , he is best known today for The Canterbury Tales .
Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of the vernacular , Middle English , at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin .
how much chicago snow did we get in 1979
The Chicago Blizzard of 1979 was a major blizzard that affected northern Illinois and northwest Indiana , U.S. on January 13 – January 14 , 1979 .
of snow fell on January 13 alone , setting a new record for snow in one calendar day .
By the end of January 14 , of snow had fallen .
The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L ' system .
Commuters crowded onto CTA buses , quickly overwhelming capacity , resulting in usual bus commutes of 30-45 minutes taking up to several hours .
To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets , the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours , adding additional time to the commute .
Deployment of plows was significantly delayed and when they finally appeared they struggled to keep up with the snowfall .
Much of the snow remained unremoved throughout the next 2 months , causing ongoing public transit delays and significant problems with trash collection .
The city 's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic , who had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J. Daley .
Newspaper articles at the time blasted Bilandic ; Jane Byrne , Bilandic 's main political rival in the Democratic primary ( who had previously worked with Bilandic in the Daley administration and been fired by Bilandic when the two could not get along ) , capitalized on this and went on to defeat Bilandic in the February 27 primary .
what does am and pm stand for
The 12-hour clock is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods : a.m. ( from the Latin ante meridiem , meaning `` before midday '' ) and p.m. ( post meridiem , `` after midday '' ) .
Each period consists of 12 hours numbered : 12 ( acting as zero ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
The 12-hour clock was developed over time from the mid-second millennium BC to the 16th century AD .
how is canada 's health care
Health spending per capita , in $ US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations .
Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States are often made by government , public health and public policy analysts .
The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s .
The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada , on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP .
In 2006 , per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US $ 3,678 ; in the U.S. , US $ 6,714 .
The U.S. spent 15.3 % of GDP on health care in that year ; Canada spent 10.0 % .
In 2006 , 70 % of health care spending in Canada was financed by government , versus 46 % in the United States .
Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23 % higher than Canadian government spending , and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83 % of total Canadian spending ( public and private ) though these statistics do n't take into account population differences .
Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending .
A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States , but differences are not consistent . ''
Life expectancy is longer in Canada , and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S. , but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences .
One commonly cited comparison , the 2000 World Health Organization 's ratings of `` overall health service performance '' , which used a `` composite measure of achievement in the level of health , the distribution of health , the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution '' , ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations .
This study rated the US `` responsiveness '' , or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment , as 1st , compared with 7th for Canada .
While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US , simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior .
The WHO 's study methods were criticized by some analyses .
Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care , assuming the population makeup is similar , a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the `` difficult research issues '' facing international comparisons .
how did the tarantula get its name ?
Tarantulas comprise a group of often hairy and very large arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders , of which approximately 900 species have been identified .
This article only describes members of Theraphosidae , although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as `` tarantulas '' .
Most species of tarantulas are not dangerous to humans , and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade .
how many pounds is a ton ?
The ton is a unit of measure .
It has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years .
It is used principally as a unit of weight , and as a unit of volume .
It can also be used as a measure of energy , for truck classification , or as a colloquial term .
It is derived from the tun , the term applied to a barrel of the largest size .
This could contain a volume between 210 and 256 gallons ( 800 to 1000 L ) , which could weigh around 2,000 pounds ( 900 kg ) and occupy some of space .
In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as ( avoirdupois pounds ) .
From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units , including the tonne ( metric ton ) , a non-SI metric unit defined as 1000 kg .
The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms , including the ton and the term `` metric ton '' for `` tonne ''
In the United States and formerly Canada a ton is defined to be .
Where confusion is possible , the 2240 lb ton is called `` long ton `` and the 2000 lb ton `` short ton `` ; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling , but usually pronounced the same as ton , hence the US term `` metric ton '' .
In the UK the final `` e '' of `` tonne '' can also be pronounced ( /ˈtʌnɪ/ ) , or `` metric ton '' when it is necessary to make the distinction .
Where accuracy is required the correct term must be used , but for many purposes this is not necessary : the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6 % , and the short ton is within 11 % of both .
The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech .
The term `` ton '' is also used to refer to a number of units of volume , ranging from in capacity .
It can also be used as a unit of energy , expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt , TNT detonated , or in refrigeration , ice melted .
In Britain , ton is used in slang in several contexts to mean `` 100 '' .
As a cost or a speed , a ton is widely understood to be £100 or 100 mph .
how many series in hockey before the stanley cup
The Stanley Cup ( ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Finals .
Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston , then- Governor General of Canada , who awarded it to Canada 's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game .
The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC .
In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup .
After a series of league mergers and folds , the Stanley `` Presentation Cup '' was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .
There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the `` Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup '' , the authenticated `` Presentation Cup '' , and the `` Replica Cup '' at the Hall of Fame .
The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks .
Nevertheless , the NHL does not actually own the trophy , but instead uses it by agreement with the two Trustees of the Cup .
The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup , although the league 's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts .
Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues of North America , a new Stanley Cup is not made each year ; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned .
It is unusual among trophies , in that it has the names of all of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff engraved on its chalice .
Initially , a new band added each year caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' .
In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band .
To avoid the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .
It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug .
The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team .
The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres ( 7.28 inches ) in height and 29 centimetres ( 11.42 inches ) in diameter .
The current Stanley Cup , topped with a copy of the original bowl , is made of a silver and nickel alloy ; it has a height of 89.54 centimetres ( 35.25 inches ) and weighs 15.5 kilograms ( 34.5 lb / 2 st 61⁄2 lb ) .
Since the 1914–15 season , the Cup has been won a combined 94 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams .
Prior to that , the challenge cup was held by nine different teams .
The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last Canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993 .
The Stanley Cup was not awarded in 1919 because of a Spanish flu epidemic , and in 2005 , as a consequence of the NHL lockout .
how do pineapples grow
The Pineapple ( Ananas comosus ) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries , and the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family .
Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit , possibly flowering in 20–24 months and fruiting in the following six months .
Pineapple does not ripen significantly post-harvest .
Pineapples are consumed fresh , cooked , juiced , and preserved , and are found in a wide array of cuisines .
In addition to consumption , in the Philippines the pineapple 's leaves are used to produce the textile fiber piña - employed as a component of wall paper and furnishings , amongst other uses .
how many bytes in an unsigned int c++
In computer science , an integer is a datum of integral data type , a data type which represents some finite subset of the mathematical integers .
Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values .
Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits .
The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers .
Computer hardware nearly always provides a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer .
how much does it cost to set up hydroelectric
The Gordon Dam in Tasmania is a large hydro facility , with an installed capacity of .
Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower ; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water .
It is the most widely used form of renewable energy , accounting for 16 percent of global electricity generation – 3,427 terawatt-hours of electricity production in 2010 , and is expected to increase about 3.1 % each year for the next 25 years .
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 .
China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 , representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use .
There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW : the Three Gorges Dam in China , Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border , and Guri Dam in Venezuela .
The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity .
The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour .
Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands .
However , damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems , and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife .
Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( ) than fossil fuel powered energy plants .
what country did wine originate in
Wine boy at a Greek symposium
The history of wine spans thousands of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture , cuisine , civilization and humanity itself .
Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest known wine production occurred in what is now the country of Georgia around 7000 BCE , with other notable sites in Greater Iran dated 4500 BCE and Armenia 4100 BCE , respectively .
The world 's oldest known winery ( dated to 3000 BCE ) was discovered in Areni-1 cave in a mountainous area of Armenia .
URL_http .
Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE .
Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ) , dated to 4500 BC .
These same sites also contain remnants of the world 's earliest evidence of crushed grapes .
In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history , playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life .
Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China .
Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930
The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times .
The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence .
Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe , the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day .
Wine , linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today 's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and , later , Roman plantations .
Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known ; the design of the wine press advanced ; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine .
Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the `` father '' of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh , earned his living as a vintner .
Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export , the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine , necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass . Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures , its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated .
Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume .
Wine production gradually increased , with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards .
Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world .
how many district are in west bengal
Districts of West Bengal
The Indian state of West Bengal borders with Nepal , Bhutan , Bangladesh and the Indian states of Bihar , Jharkhand , Odisha , Assam and Sikkim .
The Himalayas lies in the north of the state and the Bay of Bengal is at the south .
In between them , the river Ganges flows eastwards and its main distributary , the Hooghly River , flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal .
The Siliguri Corridor , which connects North-East India with rest of the India , lies in the North Bengal region of the state .
Geographically , West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions— Darjeeling Himalayan hill region , Terai and Doors region , North Bengal plains , Rarh region , Western plateau and high lands , coastal plains , Sunderbans and the Ganges Delta .
In 1947 , when India gained independence , the state of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts , as per partition plan of the then Bengal province of British India .
The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district in 1950 , and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined as part of the Hooghly district in 1954 .
The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district to the state and to enlargement of West Dinajpur district .
Later , larger districts such as West Dinajpur , 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated .
West Bengal is now divided into nineteen districts under three divisions .
Districts are administered by District Magistrates , and divisions are administered by Divisional Commissioners .
Kolkata , the capital of the state , constitutes the Kolkata district .
Other districts are further divided into administrative units such as subdivisions and blocks , administered by SDO and BDO , respectively .
The Panchayati Raj has a three-tier structure in the state .
The atomic unit is called a Gram Panchayat , which is the Panchayat organization for a collection of villages .
The block-level organizations are called Panchayat Samiti , and the district-level organizations are named Zilla Parishad .

Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate , the region comprises more than 700 islands , islets , reefs , and cays .
( See the list . )
These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea .
The Caribbean islands , consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east ( including the Leeward Antilles ) , are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping , which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago ( comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands ) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean Sea .
In a wider sense , the mainland countries of Belize and Guyana – historically and culturally part of the British West Indies – may be included .
Geopolitically , the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states , overseas departments , and dependencies .
From January 3 , 1958 , to May 31 , 1962 , there was a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories , all of which were then UK dependencies .
The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations .

how did the african slave trade affect africans in terms of economy
The main slave routes in medieval Africa .
This article discusses systems , history , and effects of slavery within Africa .
See Arab slave trade , Atlantic slave trade , Maafa , and Slavery in contemporary Africa for other discussions .
`` Slave transport in Africa '' .
Europeans usually did not enter the interior regions .
Slavery in Africa has existed throughout the continent for many centuries , and continues in the current day .
Systems of servitude and slavery were common in many parts of the continent , as they were in much of the ancient world .
In most African societies where slavery was prevalent , the enslaved people were largely treated as indentured servants and not treated as chattel slaves .
When the Arab slave trade and Atlantic slave trade began , many of the local slave systems changed and began supplying captives for slave markets outside of Africa .
Slavery in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms and some of these do not clearly fit the definitions of slavery elsewhere in the world .
Debt slavery , enslavement of war captives , military slavery , and criminal slavery were all practiced in various parts of Africa .
Although there had been some trans-Saharan trade from the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa to other regions , slavery was a small part of the economic life of many societies in Africa until the introduction of transcontinental slave trades ( Arab and Atlantic ) .
Slave practices were again transformed with European colonization of Africa and the formal abolition of slavery in the early 1900s .

what does 1 year mean to the planet
Earth is the third planet from the Sun , and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System .
It is also the largest of the Solar System 's four terrestrial planets .
It is sometimes referred to as the world or the Blue Planet .
Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago , and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years .
Earth 's biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions , which enabled the proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer , which together with Earth 's magnetic field blocked harmful solar radiation , and permitted formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land .
The physical properties of the Earth , as well as its geological history and orbit , have allowed life to persist .
Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from , to as long as .
Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments , or tectonic plates , that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years .
About 71 % of the surface is covered by salt water oceans , with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere .
Earth 's poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs .
The planet 's interior remains active , with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field , and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle .
Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon .
During one orbit around the Sun , the Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times , creating 365.26 solar days , or one sidereal year .
The Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface with a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ) .
The Moon is Earth 's only natural satellite .
It began orbiting the Earth about .
The Moon 's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides , stabilizes the axial tilt , and gradually slows the planet 's rotation .
The planet is home to millions of species of life , including humans .
Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population .
These inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states , which interact through diplomacy , travel , trade , and military action .
Human cultures have developed many views of the planet , including its personification as a planetary deity , its shape as flat , its position as the center of the universe , and in the modern Gaia Principle , as a single , self-regulating organism in its own right .
what cords are used for in wiccan
The Magician from the Waite-Smith tarot , who is depicted using the same tools that modern Wiccans use .
In the neopagan religion of Wicca , a range of magical tools are used in ritual practice .
Each of these tools has different uses and associations , and are used primarily to direct magical energies .
They are used at an altar , inside a magic circle .
In traditional Gardnerian Wicca , the tools are often divided into personal tools , which are for use by , and owned by , an individual Wiccan , and coven tools , used collectively by the coven .
This practice may derive partly from Masonic traditions ( such as the use of the Square and Compasses ) , from which Wicca draws some material , and partly from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn .
The latter made much use of material from medieval grimoires such as the Key of Solomon , which has many illustrations of magical tools and instructions for their preparation .
what is feedback mechanism in plants during respiration
Typical eukaryotic cell .
Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , and then release waste products .
The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products .
Respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity .
Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction .
The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body , most of which are redox reactions themselves .
Although technically , cellular respiration is a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell .
This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps .
While the overall reaction is a combustion reaction , no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reaction .
Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and a common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O2 ) .
The energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy , including biosynthesis , locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes .
how fire extinguisher works
A stored-pressure fire extinguisher made by Amerex
A British fire extinguisher with ID sign , call point and fire action sign
A fire extinguisher , flame extinguisher , or simply an extinguisher , is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires , often in emergency situations .
It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire , such as one which has reached the ceiling , endangers the user ( i.e. , no escape route , smoke , explosion hazard , etc . ) , or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department .
Typically , a fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire .
In the United States , fire extinguishers , in all buildings other than houses , are generally required to be serviced and inspected by a Fire Protection service company at least annually .
Some jurisdictions require more frequent service for fire extinguishers .
The servicer places a tag on the extinguisher to indicate the type of service performed ( annual inspection , recharge , new fire extinguisher ) and when .
There are two main types of fire extinguishers : stored pressure and cartridge-operated .
In stored pressure units , the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself .
Depending on the agent used , different propellants are used .
With dry chemical extinguishers , nitrogen is typically used ; water and foam extinguishers typically use air .
Stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most common type .
Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge , exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent .
This type is not as common , used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities , where they receive higher-than-average use .
They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge , allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher , recharge it , and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time .
Unlike stored pressure types , these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen , although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature ( -60 rated ) models .
Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water , wetting agent , foam , dry chemical ( classes ABC and B.C . ) , and dry powder ( class D ) types in the rest of the world .
Fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted , also called wheeled extinguishers .
Handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms ( 1 to 30 pounds ) , and are hence , easily portable by hand .
Cart-mounted units typically weigh 23+ kilograms ( 50+ pounds ) .
These wheeled models are most commonly found at construction sites , airport runways , heliports , as well as docks and marinas .
What did native americans do all day
Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples in North America within the boundaries of the present-day continental United States , Alaska , and the island state of Hawaii .
They are composed of numerous , distinct Native American tribes and ethnic groups , many of which survive as intact political communities .
The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been controversial .
According to a 1995 U.S. Census Census_Bureau Bureau Census_Bureau set of home interviews , most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as American Indians ( or simply Indians ) , and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups ; however , this term does not typically include Native Hawaiians or certain Alaskan Natives , such as Aleut , Yup'ik , or Inuit peoples .
Since the end of the 15th century , the migration of Europeans to the Americas , and their importation of Africans as slaves , has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies .
Europeans created most of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the colonists ' immigration to the Americas .
Many Native Americans lived as hunter-gatherer societies and told their histories by oral traditions .
In many groups , women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple crops : maize , beans and squash .
The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the agrarian , proto-industrial , mostly Christian immigrants from western Eurasia .
Many Native cultures were matrilineal ; the people occupied lands for use of the entire community , for hunting or agriculture .
Europeans at that time had patriarchal cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different .
The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans , as well as shifting alliances among different nations of each culture through the centuries , caused extensive political tension , ethnic violence and social disruption .
The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with infectious Eurasian diseases , to which they had no acquired immunity .
Epidemics after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations .
Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly , ranging from 1 million to 18 million .
After the colonies revolted against Great Britain and established the United States of America , President George Washington and Henry Knox conceived of the idea of `` civilizing '' Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as U.S. citizens .
Assimilation ( whether voluntary as with the Choctaw , or forced ) became a consistent policy through American administrations .
During the 19th century , the ideology of manifest destiny became integral to the American nationalist movement .
Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands , warfare between the groups , and rising tensions .
In 1830 , the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act , authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the Mississippi River , accommodating European-American expansion .
The first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers .
There were also Jesuit missionaries active in the Northern Tier .
As United States expansion reached into the American West , settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the Great Basin , Great Plains , and other Western tribes .
These were complex nomadic cultures based on horse culture and seasonal bison hunting .
They carried out strong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the American Civil War , in a series of Indian Wars , which were frequent up until the 1890s , but continued into the 20th century .
The transcontinental railroad brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west .
Over time , the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes , and established reservations for them in many western states .
U.S. agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits , but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands .
In 1924 , Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were granted citizenship by Congress .
Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations , tribes , or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights .

how does a steam engine work
An 1817 Boulton & Watt beam blowing engine , used in Netherton at the ironworks of M W Grazebrook .
Re-erected on the A38 ( M ) in Birmingham , UK
A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid .
Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years , but early devices were not practical .
Since the late 1700s steam engines have become a major source of mechanical power .
The first applications were removing water from mines .
In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotative motion .
These 10 hp engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered .
The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained .
By 1883 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible .
Steam engines could also be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives which are commonly just called steam engines outside America .
The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable .
Today steam turbines generate about 90 % of the electric power in the United States using a variety of heat sources .
Steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products .
Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used .
The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle .
In the cycle , water is heated into steam in a boiler until it reaches a high pressure .
When expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done .
The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler .
In general usage , the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants ( including boilers etc . ) such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines , or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone , as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine .
Specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler .

how is christianity viewed in australia
Christianity is the largest religion listed by Australians in the national census .
In the 2011 Census , 61.1 % of Australians were listed as Christian .
Australia has no official state religion and the Australian Constitution protects freedom of religion .
The presence of Christianity in Australia began with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convicts in 1788 .
The religion grew to account for 96.1 % of the national population at the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 .
The Anglican Church of Australia ( formerly known as the Church of England in Australia ) remained the largest denomination until 1986 , when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia .
Post-war multiculturalism and a decline in religious observance among some sections of the population have diversified the demographics of religion in Australia .
Of the roughly 61 % identifying as Christian in 2011 , the largest denominations were either Roman Catholic ( 25 % ) or Anglican ( 17 % ) , with the third largest denomination being the 5 % affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia .
Post-war immigration has grown the numbers belonging to churches like the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and there are large and growing Pentecostal groups , such as Sydney 's Hillsong Church .
The festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays in Australia .
Around a quarter of students attend church schools and Christian organisations are leading non-government providers of health and welfare services through organisations like Catholic Health Australia , Anglicare , UnitingCare Australia , the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul Society .
Historically significant Australian Christians have included Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang , Saint Mary MacKillop , Catherine Helen Spence , Pastor David Unaipon , the Reverend John Flynn and Pastor Sir Doug Nicholls .
High profile contemporary Australian Christians include : Tim Costello Baptist minister and current CEO of World Vision Australia , Frank Brennan , Jesuit human rights lawyer , Cardinal George Pell , Catholic Archbishop of Sydney , Phillip Aspinall the current Anglican Primate and Archbishop of Brisbane , Kevin Rudd , former Labor Prime Minister , and Tony Abbott , leader for the Federal Opposition Liberal Party .
how many miles is harvard university from yale university ?
Charter creating Collegiate School , which became Yale College , October 9 , 1701
Yale University is a private Ivy League research university located in New Haven , Connecticut .
Founded in 1701 in the Colony of Connecticut , the university is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States .
Originally chartered as the `` Collegiate School '' , the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to establish a college to train clergy and political leaders for the colony .
In 1718 , the College was renamed `` Yale College '' to honor a gift from Elihu Yale , a governor of the British East India Company .
In 1861 , the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first U.S. institution to award the PhD . Yale became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 .
Yale College was transformed , beginning in the 1930s , through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now exist and two more are planned .
Yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and professional students .
Almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses , more than 2,000 of which are offered annually .
The University 's assets include an endowment valued at $ 19.4 billion , the second-largest of any academic institution in the world .
Yale 's system of more than two dozen libraries holds 12.5 million volumes .
49 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the University as students , faculty , and staff .
Yale has produced many notable alumni , including five U.S. Presidents , 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices , and several foreign heads of state .

Yale Law School is the most selective law school in the United States .
Yale students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League .
The oldest intercollegiate athletic event in the United States is the Yale-Harvard regatta .
how does sagebrush effect community idaho
Artemisia tridentata ( `` big sagebrush '' or `` sagebrush '' ) is an aromatic shrub from the family Asteraceae , which grows in arid and semi-arid conditions , throughout a range of cold desert , steppe , and mountain habitats in the Intermountain West of North America .
The vernacular name `` sagebrush '' is also used for several related members of the genus Artemisia , such as California Sagebrush ( Artemisia californica ) .
Big Sagebrush and other Artemisia species are the dominant plants across large portions of the Great Basin , covering some 422,000 square miles in 11 western U.S. & Canadian states .
It is the state flower of Nevada .
Sagebrush provides food and habitat for a variety of species , such as sage grouse , pronghorn antelope , gray vireo , pygmy rabbit , and mule deer .
Big sagebrush was used as an herbal medicine by Native Americans throughout the Intermountain West of North America—especially for preventing infection in wounds , stopping internal bleeding , and treating headaches and colds .
Chemically , the active medicinal constituents include camphor , terpenoids , and tannins .
Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems , including human settlements , conversion to agricultural land , livestock grazing , invasive plant species , wildfires , and climate change .

what county is tacoma washington in
Tacoma ( , ) is a mid-sized urban port city and the county seat of Pierce County , Washington , United States .
The city is on Washington 's Puget Sound , southwest of Seattle , northeast of the state capital , Olympia , and northwest of Mount Rainier National Park .
The population was 198,397 , according to the 2010 census .
Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the third largest in the state .
Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region , which has a population of around 1 million people .
Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier , originally called Mount Tahoma .
It is known as the `` City of Destiny '' because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century .
The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma 's neighboring deep-water harbor , Commencement Bay .
By connecting the bay with the railroad Tacoma 's motto became `` When rails meet sails . ''
Today Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma , a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington state 's largest port .
Like most central cities , Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment .
Since the 1990s , developments in the downtown core include the University of Washington Tacoma ; Tacoma Link , the first modern electric light rail service in the state ; the state 's highest density of art and history museums ; and a restored urban waterfront , the Thea Foss Waterway .
With a long history of blue-collar labor politics — from the railroad workers of the 19th century , to the longshoremen of the 20th century , to the Labor Ready workers of today — Tacoma has long been known for its rough , gritty image .
A song about Tacoma , `` Thrice All American '' , by American singer-songwriter and former resident Neko Case , describes it as `` a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound / where the factories churn / and the timber 's all cut down '' .
Tacoma-Pierce County has been named one of the most livable areas in the country .
Tacoma was also recently listed as the 19th most walkable city in the country .
In contrast , the city is also ranked as the most stressed-out city in the country in a 2004 survey .
In 2006 , women 's magazine Self named Tacoma the `` Most Sexually Healthy City '' in the United States .
In 2012 , The Advocate gave Tacoma the title of `` Gayest City in America '' , in part because of the large diversity of public offices held , and Washington State passing a bill in 2012 allowing LGBT couples to marry .
Tacoma is famous for the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge .
what county is chula vista ca in
Chula Vista ( ; ) is the second largest city in the San Diego metropolitan area , the seventh largest city in Southern California , the fourteenth largest city in the State of California , and the 77th-largest city in the United States .
The population was 243,916 as of the 2010 census .
Located just from downtown San Diego and from the Mexican border in the South Bay region of the metropolitan area , the city is at the center of one of the richest economic and culturally diverse zones in the United States .
Chula Vista is so named because of its scenic location between the San Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills .
Founded in the early 19th century , fast population growth has recently been observed in the city .
As the second largest city in San Diego County , Chula Vista has quickly become a destination popular to many tourists .
Located in the city is one of America 's few year-round United States Olympic Training centers and popular tourist destinations include Cricket Wireless Amphitheater , the Chula Vista marina , and the Chula Vista Nature Center .
what does metes and bounds mean
Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land , real property ( in contrast to personal property ) or real estate .
The system has been used in England for many centuries , and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries .
By custom , it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States , and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law .
Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography , along with directions and distances , to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land .
The boundaries are described in a running prose style , working around the parcel in sequence , from a point of beginning , returning back to the same point ; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds .
It may include references to other adjoining parcels ( and their owners ) , and it , in turn , could also be referred to in later surveys .
At the time the description is compiled , it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments .
The term `` metes '' refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run , specified by a distance between the terminal points , and an orientation or direction .
A direction may be a simple compass bearing , or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods .
The term `` bounds '' refers to a more general boundary description , such as along a certain watercourse , a stone wall , an adjoining public road way , or an existing building .
The system is often used to define larger pieces of property ( e.g . farms ) , and political subdivisions ( e.g . town boundaries ) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive , or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description .
what did isaac newton do
Sir Isaac Newton ( 25 December 164220 March 1727 ) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution .
His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy '' ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics .
Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus .
Newton 's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists ' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries .
It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles .
By deriving Kepler 's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity , Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos .
Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum .
He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
In addition to his work on the calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , and developed Newton 's method for approximating the roots of a function .
Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .
He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and , unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty , he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism .
In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences , Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death .
In his later life , Newton became president of the Royal Society .
He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint .
what does the universal law of gravitation state
Prof. Walter Lewin explains Newton 's law of gravitation in MIT course 8.01
Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton 's law of gravitation
Newton 's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them .
( Separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers . )
This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Newton called induction .
It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton 's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` the Principia '' ) , first published on 5 July 1687 .
( When Newton 's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society , Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him – see History section below . )
In modern language , the law states the following:
Assuming SI units , F is measured in newtons ( N ) , m1 and m2 in kilograms ( kg ) , r in meters ( m ) , and the constant G is approximately equal to .
The value of the constant G was first accurately determined from the results of the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798 , although Cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for G .
This experiment was also the first test of Newton 's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory .
It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton 's Principia and 71 years after Newton 's death , so none of Newton 's calculations could use the value of G ; instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force .
Newton 's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb 's law of electrical forces , which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between two charged bodies .
Both are inverse-square laws , in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies .
Coulomb 's Law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses , and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constant .
Newton 's law has since been superseded by Einstein 's theory of general relativity , but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity .
Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision , or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects .
how many US soldiers killed in Iraq war
White and red flags , representing Iraqi and American deaths , sit in the grass quadrangle of The Valley Library on the Corvallis , Oregon , campus of Oregon State University .
As part of the traveling Iraq Body Count exhibit from 2008 to 2009 ( not related to Iraq Body Count project ) , the flags aim to `` raise awareness of the human cost of the Iraq War . ''
( May 2008 )
Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( beginning with the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and continuing with the ensuing occupation of Iraq , as well as the activities of the various armed groups operating in the country ) have come in many forms , and the accuracy of the information available on different types of Iraq War casualties varies greatly .
The table below summarizes various estimates of the Iraqi casualty figures .
For troops in the U.S.-led multinational coalition , the death toll is carefully tracked and updated daily , and the names and photographs of those killed in action as well as in accidents have been published widely .
A total of 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012 .
Regarding the Iraqis , however , information on both military and civilian casualties is both less precise and less consistent .
Estimates of casualty levels are available from reporters on the scene , from officials of involved organizations , and from groups that summarize information on incidents reported in the news media .
The word `` casualties `` in its most general sense includes the injured as well as the dead .
Accounts of the number of coalition wounded vary widely , partly because it is not obvious what should be counted : should only those injuries serious enough to put a soldier out of commission be included ?
Do illnesses or injuries caused by accidents count , or should the focus be restricted to wounds caused by hostile engagement ?
Sources using different definitions may arrive at very different numbers , and sometimes the precise definition is not clearly specified .
How did the highwaymen get their name 1800
Asalto al coche ( Robbery of the coach ) , by Francisco de Goya
A highwayman was a thief and brigand who preyed on travellers .
This type of outlaw usually travelled and robbed by horse , as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot .
Mounted robbers were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads .
Such robbers operated in Great Britain and Ireland from the Elizabethan era until the early 19th century .
The word highwayman is first known to be used in the year 1617 ; other euphemisms included `` knights of the road '' and `` gentlemen of the road . ''
Two terms applied to 19th-century North American highwaymen were road agents in some instances for mountain bandits while in other cases the term is Rlallaala for mountain-based ruffians .
In the same time period in Australia , they were known as bushrangers .

Johnson was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years , and was part of a group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 .
how does a cell function
Allium cells in different phases of the cell cycle
The cells of eukaryotes ( left ) and prokaryotes ( right )
The cell is the basic structural , functional and biological unit of all known living organisms .
It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing ( except virus , which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ) , and is often called the building block of life .
It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane , which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids .
Organisms can be classified as unicellular ( consisting of a single cell ; including most bacteria ) or multicellular ( including plants and animals ) .
While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species , Humans contain about 100 trillion ( 1014 ) cells .
Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope .
The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 .
The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells , that all cells come from preexisting cells , that vital functions of an organism occur within cells , and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells .
Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago .
The word cell comes from the Latin cella , meaning `` small room '' .
The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in .

what are projection headlights
A motor scooter 's front with an impractical number and variety of headlamps , added for decorative purposes
A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to light the road ahead .
Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age , spurred by the great disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities : the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark , despite only 25 % of traffic travelling during darkness .
While it is common for the term headlight to be used interchangeably in informal discussion , headlamp is the term for the device itself , while headlight properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device .
Other vehicles , such as trains and aircraft , are required to have headlamps .
Bicycle headlamps are often used on bicycles , and are required in some jurisdictions .
They can be powered by a battery or a small electrical generator on the wheel .
Additionally automotive night vision systems work to supplement headlamps .
How did women work for equal rights during the women 's movement ? Were their efforts successful ?
Women 's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide .
In some places these rights are institutionalized or supported by law , local custom , and behaviour , whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed .
They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in favour of men and boys .
Issues commonly associated with notions of women 's rights include , though are not limited to , the right : to bodily integrity and autonomy ; to vote ( suffrage ) ; to hold public office ; to work ; to fair wages or equal pay ; to own property ; to education ; to serve in the military or be conscripted ; to enter into legal contracts ; and to have marital , parental and religious rights .

how many professional hockey teams in canada
The National Hockey League ( NHL ; ) is an `` unincorporated not-for-profit association '' which operates a major professional ice hockey league of 30 franchised member clubs , of which seven are currently located in Canada and 23 in the United States .
Headquartered in New York City , the NHL is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada .
The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season .
The league was organized on November 26 , 1917 , in Montreal , Quebec , Canada , after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 .
It started with four teams and , through a series of expansions , contractions , and relocations , the league is now composed of 30 active franchises .
The nation to which the name of the league originally referred was Canada , although the league has now been binational since 1924 when it expanded into the United States .
After a labour dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 season , the league resumed play under a new collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap .
In 2009 , the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships , attendance , and television audiences .
The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries .
Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the NHL , over the past four plus decades the percentages of US and European players have increased both because of the NHL 's continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967 , and the increased availability of highly skilled European players .
what do maggots turn into to ?
Maggots feeding on carrion .
A maggot is the larva of a fly ( order Diptera ) ; it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachyceran flies , such as houseflies , cheese flies , and blowflies , rather than larvae of the Nematocera , such as mosquitoes and Crane flies .
`` Maggot '' is not a technical term and should not be taken as such ; in many standard textbooks of entomology it does not appear in the index at all .
In many non-technical texts the term is used for insect larvae in general .
Other sources have coined their own definitions ; for example : `` ...
The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared ... '' and `` ... Applied to the footless larvae of Dipters . ''
Maggot-like fly larvae are of wide importance in ecology and medicine ; among other roles , various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage , attacking crops and foodstuffs , spreading microbial infections , and causing myiasis .
how did king herod die
Herod ( , Hordos , Greek : , Hērōdēs ) , also known as Herod the Great ( 73/74 BCE – 4 BCE in Jericho ) , was a Roman client king of Judea .
His epithet of `` the Great '' is widely disputed as he is described as `` a madman who murdered his own family and a great many rabbis `` .
He is also known for his colossal building projects in Jerusalem and elsewhere , including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem ( sometimes referred to as Herod 's Temple ) and the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima .
Important details of his biography are gleaned from the works of the 1st century CE Roman–Jewish historian Josephus Flavius .
The Romans made Herod 's son , Herod Archelaus , ethnarch of Judea , Samaria , and Idumea ( biblical Edom ) from 4 BCE to 6 CE , referred to as the tetrarchy of Judea .
Archelaus was judged incompetent by the Roman emperor Augustus who then combined Samaria , Judea proper and Idumea into Iudaea province under rule of a prefect until age 41 .
Herod 's other son Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee from 4 BCE–39 CE .
what antigen in present in type o+ and o- blood
ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells and IgM antibodies present in the serum
The ABO blood group system is the most important blood type system ( or blood group system ) in human blood transfusion .
The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies , which are usually produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food , bacteria , and viruses .

how many websites on world wide web
The World Wide Web ( abbreviated as WWW or W3 , commonly known as the web ) , is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet .
With a web browser , one can view web pages that may contain text , images , videos , and other multimedia , and navigate between them via hyperlinks .
Using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like ENQUIRE , British engineer , computer scientist and at that time employee of the CERN , Sir Tim Berners-Lee , now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web .
At CERN , a European research organisation near Geneva straddling the border between France and Switzerland , Berners-Lee and Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed in 1990 to use hypertext `` to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will '' , and they publicly introduced the project in December of the same year .
How did Sen Wayne Morse die ?
Wayne Lyman Morse ( October 20 , 1900July 22 , 1974 ) was a politician and attorney from Oregon , United States , known for his proclivity for opposing his parties ' leadership , and specifically for his opposition to the Vietnam War on constitutional grounds .
Born in Madison , Wisconsin , and educated at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota Law School , Morse moved to Oregon in 1930 and began teaching at the University of Oregon School of Law .
During World War II he was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican ; he became an Independent after Dwight D. Eisenhower 's election to the presidency in 1952 .
While an independent , he set a record for performing the second longest one-person filibuster in the history of the Senate .
Morse joined the Democratic Party in 1955 , and was reelected twice while a member of that party .
Morse made a brief run for the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination in 1960 .
A few years later , Morse was one of only two Senators who opposed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which authorized the president to take military action in Vietnam without a declaration of war .
He continued to speak out against the war in the ensuing years , and lost his 1968 bid for reelection to Bob Packwood , who criticized his strong opposition to the war .
Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate before his death in 1974 .
what does a vote to table a motion mean ?
In parliamentary procedure , a motion to table has two different and contradictory meanings:
In the United States , to table usually means the to lay [ the topic ] on the table or to move for postponement of consideration ; a proposal to suspend consideration of a pending motion .
Much less often , it means a motion to `` put on the table '' : a proposal to begin consideration ( or reconsideration ) , a usage consistent with the rest of the English-speaking world .
In the rest of the English-speaking world such as the United Kingdom , to table means to move to place [ the topic ] upon the table ( or to move to place on the table ) : a proposal to begin consideration ( or reconsideration ) of a proposal .
Both the American and the British dialects have the sense of `` to table '' as to lay [ the topic ] on the table or to cause [ the topic ] to lie on the table .
The difference is the idea of what the table is for , that of a shelf off to the side , or an active work bench .
The British meaning has the sense of the table as being an active work bench , with the topic being the center of attention , considered and discussed by all until it can be resolved , at which point it is taken off the 'table ' .
The American sense is that the table is like that of a shelf , archive , or long-term storage device , where the topic has been disposed of by sending it to the 'table ' and leaving it there .

What does the class mean for SDHC cards ?
Secure Digital or ( SD ) is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices , such as mobile phones , digital cameras , GPS navigation devices , and tablet computers .
The Secure Digital standard is maintained by the SD Card Association ( SDA ) .
SD technologies have been implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of product categories and more than 8,000 models .
The Secure Digital format includes four card families available in three different form factors .
The four families are the original Standard-Capacity ( SDSC ) , the High-Capacity ( SDHC ) , the eXtended-Capacity ( SDXC ) , and the SDIO , which combines input/output functions with data storage .
The three form factors are the original size , the `` mini '' size , and the `` micro '' size ( see illustration ) .
There are many combinations of form factors and device families .
Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to hold a larger card .
Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards , but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card:
A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle .
A newer card may use a file system the host device can not navigate .
Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides .
The organization of the card was changed starting with the SDHC family .
Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so .
The SDA uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility .

how many social classes existed in the han dynasty
The Han Dynasty ( ; ) ( 206 BC – 220 AD ) was an imperial dynasty of China , preceded by the Qin Dynasty ( 221–207 BC ) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms ( 220–280 AD ) .
It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han .
It was briefly interrupted by the Xin Dynasty ( 9–23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang .
This interregnum separates the Han into two periods : the Western Han ( 206 BC – 9 AD ) and Eastern Han ( 25–220 AD ) .
Spanning over four centuries , the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history .
To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the `` Han people '' and the Chinese script is referred to as `` Han characters `` .
The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government , known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms .
These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States .
The Xiongnu , a nomadic confederation which dominated the eastern Eurasian Steppe , defeated the Han army in battle in 200 BC .
Following the defeat , a political marriage alliance was negotiated in which the Han became the de facto inferior partner .
When , despite the treaty , the Xiongnu continued to raid Han borders , Emperor Wu of Han ( r. 141–87 BC ) launched several military campaigns against them .
The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries .
These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road , which reached as far as the Mediterranean world .
Han forces managed to divide the Xiongnu into two competing nations , the Southern and Northern Xiongnu , and forced the Northern Xiongnu across the Ili River .
Despite these victories , the territories north of Han 's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei Confederation .
After 92 AD , the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics , engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empress dowagers , causing the Han 's ultimate downfall .
Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion .
Following the death of Emperor Ling ( r. 168–189 AD ) , the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers , allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire .
When Cao Pi , King of Wei , usurped the throne from Emperor Xian , the Han Dynasty ceased to exist .
The Han Dynasty was an age of economic prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou Dynasty ( c. 1050–256 BC ) .
The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang Dynasty ( 618–907 AD ) .
To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories , the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC .
These government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period , and the lost revenue was recouped through heavily taxing private entrepreneurs .
The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society .
He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class .
From the reign of Emperor Wu onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu .
This policy endured until the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 AD .
Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances , including papermaking , the nautical steering rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised-relief map , the hydraulic -powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum .
how frequently does tourettes occur
Tourette syndrome ( also called Tourette 's syndrome , Tourette 's disorder , Gilles de la Tourette syndrome , GTS or , more commonly , simply Tourette 's or TS ) is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood , characterized by multiple physical ( motor ) tics and at least one vocal ( phonic ) tic .
These tics characteristically wax and wane , can be suppressed temporarily , and are preceded by a premonitory urge .
Tourette 's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders , which includes transient and chronic tics .
Tourette 's was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome , most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks ( coprolalia ) , but this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette 's .
Tourette 's is no longer considered a rare condition , but it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence .
Between 0.4 % and 3.8 % of children ages 5 to 18 may have Tourette 's ; the prevalence of transient and chronic tics in school-age children is higher , with the more common tics of eye blinking , coughing , throat clearing , sniffing , and facial movements .
Extreme Tourette 's in adulthood is a rarity , and Tourette 's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy .
Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the etiology of Tourette 's , but the exact causes are unknown .
In most cases , medication is unnecessary .
There is no effective treatment for every case of tics , but certain medications and therapies can help when their use is warranted .
Education is an important part of any treatment plan , and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment .
Comorbid conditions ( co-occurring diagnoses other than Tourette 's ) such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and obsessive–compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are present in many patients seen in tertiary specialty clinics .
These other conditions often cause more functional impairment to the individual than the tics that are the hallmark of Tourette 's , hence it is important to correctly identify comorbid conditions and treat them .
The eponym was bestowed by Jean-Martin Charcot ( 1825–1893 ) on behalf of his resident , Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette ( 1859–1904 ) , a French physician and neurologist , who published an account of nine patients with Tourette 's in 1885 .

how many canals in mandibular first molar
The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally ( away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial ( toward the midline of the face ) from both mandibular second molars .
It is located on the mandibular ( lower ) arch of the mouth , and generally opposes the maxillary ( upper ) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion .
The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication , commonly known as chewing .
There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars : two on the buccal ( side nearest the cheek ) , two lingual ( side nearest the tongue ) , and one distal .
There are great differences between the deciduous ( baby ) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars , even though their function are similar .
The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it .
Despite being named molars , the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars .
In the universal system of notation , the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase .
The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as `` S '' , and the left one is known as `` L '' .
The international notation has a different system of notation .
Thus , the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as `` 84 '' , and the left one is known as `` 74 '' .
In the universal system of notation , the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number .
The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as `` 30 '' , and the left one is known as `` 19 '' .
The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found .
For this tooth , the left and right first molars would have the same number , `` 6 '' , but the right one would have the symbol , `` ┐ '' , over it , while the left one would have , `` ┌ '' .
The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two , and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as `` 46 '' , and the left one is known as `` 36 '' .
Mandibular primary first molars usually have four pulp horns .
The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones .
Anatomy : The mandibular first molar has five cusps : the mesiobuccal ( MB , toward midline and cheek ) , mesiolingual ( ML , toward midline and tongue ) , distolingual ( DL , away from midline and towards tongue ) , distobuccal ( DB , away from midline and toward cheek ) , and distal ( D , away from midline ) , listed in order of decreasing size .
Listed in order of decreasing height they are : ML , DL , DF , MF , and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child .
Viewed from the top of the tooth ( occlusal view ) , the mandibular first molar is pentagonal ( five sided ) in shape and tapers toward the lingual , with the sides being the buccal surface , the mesial surface , the lingual surface , distal surface , and the distobuccal surface .
The occlusal surface has four grooves .
The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits ( mesial , central , central , and distal ) .
The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps .
The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps .
The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit .
The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves ( buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel ) .
From the buccal ( buccal view ) , two roots are present .
The distal root is generally straighter , although both often have a slight distal curvature .
The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown .

How Hydrogen Fuel For Cars Work
Honda FCX Clarity , a hydrogen fuel cell demonstration vehicle introduced in 2008
A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power .
Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets , as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles .
The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine , or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors .
Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy .
Hydrogen fuel does not occur naturally on Earth and thus is not an energy source ; rather it is an energy carrier .
It is most frequently made from methane or other fossil fuels , but it can be produced using sources ( such as wind , solar , or nuclear ) that are intermittent , too diffuse or too cumbersome to directly propel vehicles .
Integrated wind-to-hydrogen plants , using electrolysis of water , are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough , and quantities great enough , to compete with traditional energy sources .
Many companies are working to develop technologies that might efficiently exploit the potential of hydrogen energy for mobile uses .
The attraction of using hydrogen as an energy currency is that , if hydrogen is prepared without using fossil fuel inputs , vehicle propulsion would not contribute to carbon dioxide emissions .
The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high capital cost , low energy content per unit volume , high tankage weights , very high storage vessel pressures , the storage , transportation and filling of gaseous or liquid hydrogen in vehicles , the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles , and the inefficiency of production processes .

What does the idea of effective nuclear charge tell us
Effective Nuclear Charge Diagram
The effective nuclear charge ( often symbolize as or Z* ) is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom .
The term `` effective '' is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge by the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons .
The effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer shell electron is also called the core charge .
It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by looking at the oxidation number of the atom .

The second and third seasons of the show drew on footage and elements from the Super Sentai series Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger respectively , though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the five main Rangers and several regular villains .
Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger costume ( worn by the White Ranger ) were retained from Dairanger for the second season , while only the mecha from Kakuranger were featured in the third season .
However the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the title characters of the mini-series , Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers .
The series was produced by MMPR Productions , distributed by Saban Entertainment , and aired on Fox Kids .
The show 's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment .
In 1996 , the series was rebranded as the Power Rangers franchise ; renaming the series every year after , and using costumes , props , and footage from subsequent Super Sentai series , as well as changing the cast and storyline .
While an overarching storyline would continue until Power Rangers Lost Galaxy , subsequent series after MMPR are not sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense .
In 2010 , a re-version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , with a new logo , comic book-referenced graphics , and extra alternative special effects , was broadcast on ABC Kids , and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series .
How did Edgar Allan Poe die ?
Edgar Allan Poe ( born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 – October 7 , 1849 ) was an American author , poet , editor and literary critic , considered part of the American Romantic Movement .
Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre , Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre .
He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction .
He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career .
He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston , Massachusetts ; he was orphaned young when his mother died shortly after his father abandoned the family .
Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan , of Richmond , Virginia , but they never formally adopted him .
He attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money .
After enlisting in the Army and later failing as an officer 's cadet at West Point , Poe parted ways with the Allans .
His publishing career began humbly , with an anonymous collection of poems , Tamerlane and Other Poems ( 1827 ) , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' .
Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism .
His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City .
In Baltimore in 1835 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin .
In January 1845 Poe published his poem , `` The Raven `` , to instant success .
His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication .
He began planning to produce his own journal , The Penn ( later renamed The Stylus ) , though he died before it could be produced .
On October 7 , 1849 , at age 40 , Poe died in Baltimore ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease , rabies , suicide , tuberculosis , and other agents .
Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world , as well as in specialized fields , such as cosmology and cryptography .
Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature , music , films , and television .
A number of his homes are dedicated museums today .
The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre .
how do producers eat carnivores
Lions are obligate carnivores ; they require up to seven kilograms ( 15 lbs ) of meat per day .
A major component of their diet is the flesh of large mammals , like this African buffalo .
A carnivore ( ) meaning 'meat eater ' ( Latin , caro meaning 'meat ' or 'flesh ' and vorare meaning 'to devour ' ) is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue , whether through predation or scavenging .
Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are considered carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are considered carnivores .
Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food , and apart from the more general definition , there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore .
A carnivore that sits at the top of the foodchain is an apex predator .
Plants that capture and digest insects are called carnivorous plants .
Similarly , fungi that capture microscopic animals are often called carnivorous fungi .
how many teams are in the world cup
The FIFA World Cup , often simply the World Cup , is an international association football competition contested by the senior men 's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body .
The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War .
The current champions are Spain , who won the 2010 tournament .
The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation ( s ) over a period of about a month ; this phase is often called the World Cup Finals .
A qualification phase , which currently takes place over the preceding three years , is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation ( s ) .
The 19 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different national teams .
Brazil have won five times , and they are the only team to have played in every tournament .
The other World Cup winners are Italy , with four titles ; Germany , with three titles ; Argentina and inaugural winners Uruguay , with two titles each ; and England , France , and Spain , with one title each .

what crimes do not have digital evidence
Aerial photo of FLETC , where US digital forensics standards were developed in the 1980s and '90s
Digital forensics ( sometimes known as digital forensic science ) is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices , often in relation to computer crime .
The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data .
With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early '80s , the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s , and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged .
Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications .
The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil ( as part of the electronic discovery process ) courts .
Forensics may also feature in the private sector ; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation ( a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion ) .
The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches , relating to the type of digital devices involved ; computer forensics , network forensics , forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics .
The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure , forensic imaging ( acquisition ) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence .
As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime , digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects , confirm alibis or statements , determine intent , identify sources ( for example , in copyright cases ) , or authenticate documents .
Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis ( where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions ) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses .
what color space should i use
A comparison of the chromaticities enclosed by some color spaces .
A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers , typically as three or four values or color components ( e.g . RGB and CMYK are color models ) .
However , a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation .
Adding a certain mapping function between the color model and a certain reference color space results in a definite `` footprint '' within the reference color space .
This `` footprint '' is known as a gamut , and , in combination with the color model , defines a new color space .
For example , Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces , both based on the RGB model .
In the most generic sense of the definition above , color spaces can be defined without the use of a color model .
These spaces , such as Pantone , are in effect a given set of names or numbers which are defined by the existence of a corresponding set of physical color swatches .
This article focuses on the mathematical model concept .

what does life insurance cover ?
Life insurance is a contract between an insured ( insurance policy holder ) and an insurer , where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money ( the `` benefits '' ) upon the death of the insured person .
Depending on the contract , other events such as terminal illness or critical illness may also trigger payment .
The policy holder typically pays a premium , either regularly or as a lump sum .
Other expenses ( such as funeral expenses ) are also sometimes included in the benefits .
Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events .
Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer ; common examples are claims relating to suicide , fraud , war , riot and civil commotion .
Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:
Protection policies – designed to provide a benefit in the event of specified event , typically a lump sum payment .
A common form of this design is term insurance .
Investment policies – where the main objective is to facilitate the growth of capital by regular or single premiums .
Common forms ( in the US ) are whole life , universal life and variable life policies .

how many consoles has xbox 360 sold
The Xbox 360 is the second video game console developed by and produced for Microsoft and the successor to the Xbox .
The Xbox 360 competes with Sony 's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles .
As of September 30 , 2012 , 70 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide .
The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12 , 2005 , with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) .
The console sold out completely upon release in all regions except in Japan .
Several major features of the Xbox 360 are its integrated Xbox Live service that allows players to compete online ; download arcade games , game demos , trailers , TV shows , music and movies ; and its Windows Media Center multimedia capabilities .
The Xbox Live also offers access to various ( often region-specific ) third-party media streaming applications .
At their E3 presentation on June 14 , 2010 , Microsoft announced a redesigned Xbox 360 that would ship on the same day .
The redesigned console is slimmer than the previous Xbox 360 model and features integrated 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi , TOSLINK S/PDIF optical audio output , five USB 2.0 ports ( compared to the three from older versions ) and a special AUX port .

how is a backpack made
Backpack may also refer to a 2001 novel by Emily Barr
A modern backpack
Swiss army backpack ca . 1960
Integrated bearer frame .
A backpack ( also called rucksack , knapsack , packsack , pack ) is , in its simplest form , a cloth sack carried on one 's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders , but there can be exceptions .
Lightweight types of backpacks are sometimes worn on only one shoulder strap .
Backpacks are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment , because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands .
Large backpacks , used to carry loads over 10 kg ( 22 lbs ) , usually offload the largest part ( up to about 90 % ) of their weight onto padded hip belts , leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load .
This improves the potential to carry heavy loads , as the hips are stronger than the shoulders , and also increases agility and balance , since the load rides nearer the wearer 's own center of mass .
In ancient times , the backpack was used as a means to carry the hunter 's larger game and other types of prey and as a way of easier transport for other materials .
In the cases of larger hunts , the hunters would dismember their prey and distribute the pieces of the animal around , each one packing the meat into many wrappings and then into bags which they placed on to their backs .
The bag itself was made up of different animal hide and skin ( depending on what sorts of animals were in the area ) and sewn together by the intestines of said animals , which were woven together tightly to make a sturdy thread-like material .
WHAT COUNTRY IS MEXICO IN

It is bordered on the north by the United States ; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; on the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico .
Covering almost two million square kilometres ( over 760,000 sq mi ) , Mexico is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world .
With an estimated population of over 113 million , it is the world 's eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country .
Mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a Federal District , the capital city .
In pre-Columbian Mexico many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec , the Toltec , the Teotihuacan , the Zapotec , the Maya and the Aztec before first contact with Europeans .
In 1521 , Spain conquered and colonized the territory from its base in México-Tenochtitlan , which was administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain .
This territory would eventually become Mexico following recognition of the colony 's independence in 1821 .
The post-independence period was characterized by economic instability , the Mexican-American War and territorial cession to the United States , a civil war , two empires and a domestic dictatorship .
The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910 , which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country 's current political system .
Elections held in July 2000 marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party .
Since 2006 the country has been in the midst of a drug war which has caused 60,000 deaths .
Mexico has one of the world 's largest economies , and is considered both a regional power and middle power .
In addition , Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ( since 1994 ) , and considered an upper-middle income country by the World Bank .
Mexico is considered a newly industrialized country and an emerging power .
It has the fourteenth largest nominal GDP and the eleventh largest GDP by purchasing power parity .
The economy is strongly linked to those of its North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) partners , especially the United States of America .
Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in the Americas by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 31 , and in 2007 was the tenth most visited country in the world with 21.4 million international arrivals per year .
how is slugging percentage calculated
Babe Ruth holds the MLB career slugging percentage record ( .690 ) .
In baseball statistics , slugging percentage ( abbreviated SLG ) is a popular measure of the power of a hitter .
It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats :
where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player , and 1B , 2B , 3B , and HR are the number of singles , doubles , triples , and home runs , respectively .
Walks are specifically excluded from this calculation .
For example , in 1920 , Babe Ruth played his first season for the New York Yankees .
In 458 at bats , Ruth had 172 hits , comprising 73 singles , 36 doubles , 9 triples , and 54 home runs , which brings the total base count to ( 73 × 1 ) + ( 36 × 2 ) + ( 9 × 3 ) + ( 54 × 4 ) = 388 .
His total number of bases ( 388 ) divided by his total at-bats ( 458 ) is .847 , his slugging percentage for the season .
The next year he slugged .846 , and these records went unbroken until 2001 , when Barry Bonds achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats , bringing his slugging percentage to .863 , unmatched since .

how does heat stroke affect the heart
Hyperthermia is elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation that occurs when a body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates .
Extreme temperature elevation then becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death .
The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs .
The former is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat , or combination of heat and humidity , that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms .
The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs , particularly those that affect the central nervous system .
Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia .
Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and may be used in the treatment of some kinds of cancer and other conditions , most commonly in conjunction with radiotherapy .
Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body 's temperature set point remains unchanged .
The opposite is hypothermia , which occurs when the temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism .

how many stars on the first american flag
The `` Betsy Ross '' flag
A `` Betsy Ross '' flag flying outside San Francisco City Hall
The Betsy Ross flag is an early design of the flag of the United States , popularly attributed to Betsy Ross , using the common motifs of alternating red-and-white striped field with five-pointed stars in a blue canton .
The flag was designed during the American Revolution and features 13 stars to represent the original 13 colonies .
The distinctive feature of the Ross flag is the arrangement of the stars in a circle .
Although the Betsy Ross story is accepted by most Americans , some flag historians and revisionists do not accept the Betsy Ross design as the first American flag .
According to the traditional account , the original flag was made in June 1776 , when a small committee—including George Washington , Robert Morris and relative George Ross —visited Betsy and discussed the need for a new American flag .
Betsy accepted the job to manufacture the flag , altering the committee 's design by replacing the six-pointed stars with five-pointed stars .
While the Betsy Ross legend is questionable , the flag design is known to have been in use by 1777 ; Alfred B . Street described it at the surrender of General Burgoyne and understood the circle of stars to represent equality among the American states .
It is one of the oldest versions of U.S. flags known to exist ; while it is not the oldest surviving flag artifact in cloth form , its likeness appears on older physical relics , namely , the contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale .
They depict the circular star arrangement being flown from ship masts and many other places , and thus provide the first known historical documentation of the flag 's appearance .
The seal of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs uses the Betsy Ross flag to represent service to all veterans from the American Revolution to the present day .
The Betsy Ross design of 13-star US flags has been featured in many popular artworks ( sometimes inaccurately , as in Washington Crossing the Delaware ) and films , such as the 1960 version of Pollyanna .
The flag continues to be one of the most popular symbols of the American Revolution .
how does a cat purr
A purr is a sound made by all species of felids and is a part of cat communication .
It varies between cats ( for example by loudness and tone ) , and from species to species , but can be characterized as a tonal buzzing .
The term `` purring '' has been used liberally in literature , and it has been claimed that viverrids ( civet , mongoose , genet ) , bears , badgers , hyaenas ( et cetera ) purr .
Other animals that have been said to purr are rabbits , squirrels , guinea pigs , tapirs , ring-tailed lemurs , elephants , raccoons and gorillas while eating .
However , using a strict definition of purring that continuous sound production must alternate between pulmonic egressive and ingressive airstream ( and usually go on for minutes ) , Peters ( 2002 ) , in an exhaustive review of the scientific literature , reached the conclusion that until then only ‘purring cats’ ( Felidae ) and two species of genets , Genetta tigrina , and most likely also Genetta genetta , had been documented to purr .
what do platypus eat
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia , including Tasmania .
Together with the four species of echidna , it is one of the five extant species of monotremes , the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth .
It is the sole living representative of its family ( Ornithorhynchidae ) and genus ( Ornithorhynchus ) , though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record .
The unusual appearance of this egg-laying , duck -billed , beaver -tailed , otter -footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it , with some considering it an elaborate fraud .
It is one of the few venomous mammals , the male platypus having a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans .
The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia ; it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the reverse of its 20-cent coin .
The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales .
Until the early 20th century , it was hunted for its fur , but it is now protected throughout its range .
Although captive breeding programmes have had only limited success and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution , it is not under any immediate threat .

Most ubiquitously , users require the ability to cut and paste sections of plain text .
The cut command removes the selected data from its original position , while the copy command creates a duplicate ; in both cases the selected data is placed in a clipboard .
The data in the clipboard is later inserted in the position where the paste command is issued .
The command names are an interface metaphor based on the physical procedure used in manuscript editing to create a page layout .
This interaction technique has close associations with related techniques in graphical user interfaces that use pointing devices such as a computer mouse ( by drag and drop , for example ) .
how do we calculate the cost of ordering inventory , pp ?
Economic order quantity is the order quantity that minimizes total inventory holding costs and ordering costs .
It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models .
The framework used to determine this order quantity is also known as Barabas EOQ Model or Barabas Formula .
The model was developed by Ford W. Harris in 1913 , but R. H. Wilson , a consultant who applied it extensively , is given credit for his in-depth analysis .
what happened to stevie ray vaughan
Stephen `` Stevie '' Ray Vaughan ( October 3 , 1954 – August 27 , 1990 ) was an American guitarist , singer-songwriter , and record producer .
Often referred to by his initials SRV , Vaughan is best known as a founding member and leader of Double Trouble .
Together with drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon , they ignited the blues revival of the 1980s .
With a career spanning seven years , Vaughan and Double Trouble consistently sold out concerts while their albums frequently went gold .
He was born and raised in Dallas , Texas , and for a short period of time lived in Graham , Texas .
As the younger brother of Jimmie Vaughan , Vaughan started playing the guitar at age seven and formed several bands that occasionally performed in local nightclubs .
At age 17 , he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin to further pursue his musical career , joining groups such as Krackerjack , the Nightcrawlers , and the Cobras .
In 1977 , he formed Triple Threat Revue , a band that eventually evolved into Double Trouble and regularly performed around Austin .
In 1982 , Vaughan and Double Trouble performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland , catching the attention of musicians David Bowie and Jackson Browne .
Bowie asked Vaughan to play on his upcoming studio album Let 's Dance , while Browne offered the band free use of his personal studio in Los Angeles to record an album .
In March 1983 , Vaughan and Double Trouble were signed to Epic Records by veteran record producer John Hammond Sr. and released their debut album , Texas Flood in June of that year .
After successful touring , the group released the albums , Could n't Stand the Weather ( 1984 ) and Soul to Soul ( 1985 ) , the latter of which featured new keyboardist Reese Wynans .
Although his career had progressed successfully , Vaughan checked into a rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta , Georgia to give up a cocaine and alcohol habit and returned to touring with the band .
In June 1989 , In Step was released and earned them a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Performance .
On August 27 , 1990 , Vaughan was killed in a helicopter crash following a performance in East Troy , Wisconsin .
Vaughan 's uniquely eclectic yet intense style was derived from a variety of musical genres .
He was influenced by blues musicians including Albert King , Freddie King , Otis Rush , and Muddy Waters , and rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack .
His guitar playing reflected the classic blues and pentatonic scales .
He has received wide critical recognition for his guitar playing , ranking at # 6 on Rolling Stones list of `` 100 Greatest Guitarists '' in 2011 .
He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000 and a memorial statue was erected in Austin 's Auditorium Shores park .
Stevie Ray Vaughan is widely considered to be one of the greatest musicians to come from the state of Texas .
what does coca cola do for nausea/vomiting
The Las Vegas Strip World of Coca-Cola museum in 2003
Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores , restaurants , and vending machines in every country except Cuba and North Korea .
It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta , Georgia , and is often referred to simply as Coke ( a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27 , 1944 ) .
Originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton , Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler , whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century .
The company produces concentrate , which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world .
The bottlers , who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company , produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners .
The bottlers then sell , distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores and vending machines .
Such bottlers include Coca-Cola Enterprises , which is the largest single Coca-Cola bottler in North America and western Europe .
The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains to major restaurants and food service distributors .
The Coca-Cola Company has , on occasion , introduced other cola drinks under the Coke brand name .
The most common of these is Diet Coke , with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola , Diet Coke Caffeine-Free , Coca-Cola Cherry , Coca-Cola Zero , Coca-Cola Vanilla , and special versions with lemon , lime or coffee .
Based on Interbrand 's best global brand 2011 , Coca-Cola was the world 's most valuable brand .

how the capital of brazil , brasilia was created
Brasília ( ) is the federal capital of Brazil and the seat of government of the Federal District .
Administratively , the city is located in the Federal District which is in the Central-West Region .
Physically , it is located in the Brazilian Highlands .
It has a population of about 2,562,963 ( 3,716,996 in the metropolitan area ) as of the 2008 IBGE estimate , making it the fourth largest city in Brazil .
However , as a metropolitan area , it ranks lower at sixth in population .
Brasília is the largest city in the world that did not exist at the beginning of the 20th century .
Brasília has the fifth largest GDP among Latin American cities and the third in Brazil .
At around R $ 62,000 Brazilian reais ( equal to approximately $ 30,900 US dollars or €23,000 euros ) , the city 's per capita income is the highest among Brazil 's largest cities .
As the national capital , Brasília is the seat of all three branches of the federal government of Brazil .
The city also hosts the headquarters of many Brazilian companies .
Planning policies such as the location of residential buildings around expansive urban areas , as well as building the city around large avenues and dividing it into sectors , have sparked a debate and reflection on life in big cities in the 20th century .
The city 's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities , such as the Hotel Sector , the Banking Sector or the Embassy Sector .
Brasília hosts 124 foreign embassies .
The city was planned and developed in 1956 with Lúcio Costa as the principal urban planner , Oscar Niemeyer as the principal architect and Roberto Burle Marx as the landscape designer .
Brasilia is in the Unesco 's World Hertitage List due to its architecture .
On April 22 , 1960 , it formally became Brazil 's national capital .
Viewed from above , the main portion of the city resembles an airplane or a butterfly .
The city is commonly referred to as Capital Federal , or simply BSB .
Residents of Brasília are known as brasilienses or candangos ( the latter referring to those not born in the city but who migrated there after it was established ) .
In local usage , the word `` Brasília '' usually refers only to the First Administrative Region ( RA I ) within the Federal District ( Distrito Federal ) , where the most important government buildings are located .
Brasília has a unique status in Brazil , as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like nearly all cities in Brazil .
Nationally , the term is almost always used synonymously with the Federal District , which constitutes an indivisible Federative Unit , analogous to a state .
Several `` satellite cities '' exist which are also part of the Federal District .
Brasília International Airport is the main airport in Brasília , connecting the capital to all major Brazilian cities and many international destinations .
It is the third most important airport in Brazil , in terms of passengers and aircraft movements .
what caused ww
Personifications of Germany , France , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and the United Kingdom attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war .
They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in in 1914 .
The causes of World War I , which began in central Europe in late July 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war .
Militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well .
The immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the Crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the Archduke of Austria Hungary ) and his wife Sophie by Gavrilo Princip , an irredentist Serb .
The crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers ( Italy , France , Germany , the British Empire , the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia ) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high .
In turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867 .
The more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans .
Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
Although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between the various European powers since 1870 .
Some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across Europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in Europe , convoluted and fragmented governance , the arms races of the previous decades , previous military planning , imperial and colonial rivalry for wealth , power and prestige , and economic and military rivalry in industry and trade – e.g. , the Pig War between Austria and Serbia .
Other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent ( e.g. , the German belief that the United Kingdom would remain neutral ) and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications .
The various categories of explanation for World War I correspond to different historians ' overall methods .
Most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .
The deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake .
In attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war .
Early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War '' were shown to be incomplete and biased .
In addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between Russia and France , were found to have been doctored .
Even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war .
What country has a single solid color flag
Johnson 's new chart of national emblems , published c. 1868 .
The large flags shown in the corners are the 37-star flag of the United States ( flown 1867-1877 ) , the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom , the Russian Imperial Standard , and the French tricolore with inset Imperial Eagle .
Various other flags flown by ships are shown .
The Flag of Cuba is labelled `` Cuban ( so called ) `` .
The Chinese dragon on the Flag of China was drawn mistakenly as a western dragon .
A national flag is a flag that symbolizes a country .
The flag is flown by the government , but usually can also be flown by citizens of the country .
Both public and private buildings such as schools and courthouses may fly the national flag .
In some countries , the national flags are only flown from non-military buildings on certain flag days .
There are three distinct types of national flag for use on land , and three for use at sea , though many countries use identical designs for several ( and sometimes all ) of these types of flag .
how did the civil war end
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .
what causes Phthisis bulbi after birth
Norrie disease is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the eye and almost always leads to blindness .
In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms , some patients suffer from a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life , while another portion may be mentally challenged .
Patients with Norrie disease may develop cataracts , leukocoria ( a condition where the pupils appear white when light is shone on them ) , along with other developmental issues in the eye , such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the iris .
Around 30–50 % of them will also have developmental delay/ mental retardation , psychotic-like features , incoordination of movements or behavioral abnormalities .
Most patients are born with normal hearing ; however , the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence .
About 15 % of the patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease .
The disease affects almost only male infants at birth or soon after birth , because the disease is inherited X-linked recessive .
Only in very rare cases , females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease as well .
The exact incidence number is unknown ; only a few hundred cases have been reported so far .
It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups .
what kind of legal remedy is it to ask someone to fulfill there promise
A contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties , each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between them .
The elements of a contract are `` offer '' and `` acceptance '' by `` competent persons '' having legal capacity who exchange `` consideration '' to create `` mutuality of obligation . ''
Proof of some or all of these elements may be done in writing , though contracts may be made entirely orally or by conduct .
The remedy for breach of contract can be `` damages '' in the form of compensation of money or specific performance enforced through an injunction .
Both of these remedies award the party at loss the `` benefit of the bargain '' or expectation damages , which are greater than mere reliance damages , as in promissory estoppel .
The parties may be natural persons or juristic persons .
A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur .
The word promise can be used as a legal synonym for contract , although care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract , as when it is an agreement without consideration .
Contract law varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another , including differences in common law compared to civil law , the impact of received law , particularly from England in common law countries , and of law codified in regional legislation .
Regarding Australian Contract Law for example , there are 40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the Commonwealth ( Federal / national ) level , and an additional 26 acts at the level of the state of NSW .
In addition there are 6 international instruments or conventions which are applicable for international dealings , such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods .

how does lsd impact the human body
Lysergic acid diethylamide , abbreviated LSD or LSD-25 , also known as lysergide ( INN ) and colloquially as acid , is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the ergoline family , well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes , closed and open eye visuals , synesthesia , an altered sense of time and spiritual experiences , as well as for its key role in 1960s counterculture .
It is used mainly as an entheogen , recreational drug , and as an agent in psychedelic therapy .
LSD is non-addictive , is not known to cause brain damage , and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose .
However , adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety , paranoia , and delusions are possible .
LSD was first synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1938 from ergotamine , a chemical derived by Arthur Stoll from ergot , a grain fungus that typically grows on rye .
The short form `` LSD '' comes from its early code name LSD-25 , which is an abbreviation for the German `` Lysergsäure-diethylamid '' followed by a sequential number .
LSD is sensitive to oxygen , ultraviolet light , and chlorine , especially in solution , though its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at low temperature .
In pure form it is a colorless , odorless , tasteless solid .
LSD is typically delivered orally , usually on a substrate such as absorbent blotter paper , a sugar cube , or gelatin .
In its liquid form , it can also be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection .
LSD is very potent , with 20–30 μg ( micrograms ) being the threshold dose .
New experiments with LSD started in 2009 for the first time in 40 years .
Introduced by Sandoz Laboratories , with trade-name Delysid , as a drug with various psychiatric uses in 1947 , LSD quickly became a therapeutic agent that appeared to show great promise .
In the 1950s , officials at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) thought the drug might be applicable to mind control and chemical warfare ; the agency 's MKULTRA research program propagated the drug among young servicemen and students .
The subsequent recreational use of the drug by youth culture in the Western world during the 1960s led to a political firestorm that resulted in its prohibition .
Currently , a number of organizations—including the Beckley Foundation , MAPS , Heffter Research Institute and the Albert Hofmann Foundation—exist to fund , encourage and coordinate research into the medicinal and spiritual uses of LSD and related psychedelics .
how many hours apart do navy seals run
The United States Navy 's Sea , Air , Land Teams , commonly known as the Navy SEALs , are the U.S. Navy 's principal special operations force and a part of the Naval Special Warfare Command and United States Special Operations Command .
`` SEAL '' is always capitalized in reference to members of the Naval Special Warfare community .
The acronym is derived from their capacity to operate at sea , in the air , and on land .
SEALs are male members of the United States Navy .
An exchange program with the Coast Guard , which graduated three Coast Guardsmen as SEALs , was suspended in 2011 .
The CIA 's highly secretive Special Activities Division ( SAD ) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group ( SOG ) recruits operators from the SEAL Teams .
Joint Navy SEALs and CIA operations go back to the famed MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War .
This cooperation still exists today and is seen in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and in the finding and killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan .
how many people are in the world
World population estimates from 1800 to 2100 , based on UN 2010 projections ( red , orange , green ) and US Census Bureau historical estimates ( black ) .
Actual recorded population figures are in blue .
According to the highest estimate , the world population may rise to 16 billion by 2100 ; according to the lowest estimate , it may decline to 6 billion .
The world population is the total number of living humans on Earth .
As of today , it is estimated to number billion by the United States Census Bureau ( USCB ) .
The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12 , 2012 .
According to a separate estimate by the United Nations Population Fund , it reached this milestone on October 31 , 2011 .
The world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350 , when it stood at around 370 million .
The highest rates of growth – global population increases above 1.8 % per year – were seen briefly during the 1950s , and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s .
The growth rate peaked at 2.2 % in 1963 , and had declined to 1.1 % by 2011 .
Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million , and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million , while deaths number 56 million per year , and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 .
Current projections show a continued increase in population in the near future ( but a steady decline in the population growth rate ) , with the global population expected to reach between 7.5 and 10.5 billion by 2050 .
Various longer-term estimates predict further growth , stagnation , or even overall decline in the global population by 2150 .
Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth , citing the growing pressures on the environment , global food supplies , and energy resources .

how many muscles in the human body
Skeletal muscles homo sapiens
This is a table of muscles of the human anatomy .
There are approximately 642 skeletal muscles within the typical human , and almost every muscle constitutes one part of a pair of identical bilateral muscles , found on both sides , resulting in approximately 320 pairs of muscles , as presented in this article .
Nevertheless , the exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles differently , e.g . regarding what is defined as different parts of a single muscle or as several muscles .
Examples range from 640 to 850 .
The muscles of the human body can be categorized into a number of groups which include muscles relating to the head and neck , muscles of the torso or trunk , muscles of the upper limbs , and muscles of the lower limbs .
The action refers to the action of each muscle from the standard anatomical position .
In other positions , other actions may be performed .
how did seminole war end
A reenactment of a battle at Fort Foster , 1837 ( at Hillsborough River State Park )
The Seminole Wars , also known as the Florida Wars , were three conflicts in Florida between the Seminole — the collective name given to the amalgamation of various groups of native Americans and Black people who settled in Florida in the early 18th century — and the United States Army .

how does the brain process language
Broca 's and Wernicke 's Areas
Language processing refers to the way human beings use words to communicate ideas and feelings , and how such communications are processed and understood .
Thus it is how the brain creates and understands language .
Most recent theories consider that this process is carried out entirely by and inside the brain .
This is considered one of the most characteristic abilities of the human species - perhaps the most characteristic .
However very little is known about it and there is huge scope for research on it .
Most of the knowledge acquired to date on the subject has come from patients who have suffered some type of significant head injury , whether external ( wounds , bullets ) or internal ( strokes , tumors , degenerative diseases ) .
Studies have shown that most of the language processing functions are carried out in the cerebral cortex .
The essential function of the cortical language areas is symbolic representation .
Even though language exists in different forms , all of them are based on symbolic representation .

what do ancients myths explain
Bust of Zeus , Otricoli ( Sala Rotonda , Museo Pio-Clementino , Vatican ) .
Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices .
It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece and is part of religion in modern Greece and around the world , known as Hellenismos .
Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .
Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts .
Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines , and mythological creatures .
These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .
The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on events surrounding the Trojan War .
Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices .
Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .
Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts .
Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles .
In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence .
Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language .
Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .

how much money did charlie chaplin make in any year in the 1920
Sir Charles Spencer `` Charlie '' Chaplin , ( 16 April 188925 December 1977 ) was a British comic actor and filmmaker who rose to fame in the silent era .
Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona `` the Tramp `` and is considered one of the most important figures of the film industry .
His career spanned more than 75 years , from a child in the Victorian era to close to his death at the age of 88 , and encompassed both adulation and controversy .
Raised in London , Chaplin 's childhood was defined by poverty and hardship .
He was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine ; his father was absent , and his mother was committed to a mental asylum .
Chaplin began performing from a young age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian .
At 19 he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America .
Chaplin was scouted by the film industry , and made his first appearances in 1914 with Keystone Studios .
He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base .
Chaplin directed his films from an early stage , and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations .
By 1918 , he was one of the most famous men in the world .
In 1919 , Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists , giving him complete control over his films .
His first feature-length picture was The Kid ( 1921 ) , followed by A Woman of Paris ( 1923 ) , The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) , and The Circus ( 1928 ) .
He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s , instead producing City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) without dialogue .
Chaplin became increasingly political and his next film , The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) , satirised Adolf Hitler .
The 1940s was a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin , and his popularity declined rapidly .
He was accused of communist sympathies , while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women were considered scandalous .
An FBI investigation was opened on Chaplin , and he was eventually forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland .
He abandoned the Tramp for his later films , which include Monsieur Verdoux ( 1947 ) , Limelight ( 1952 ) , A King in New York ( 1957 ) , and A Countess From Hong Kong ( 1967 ) .
Chaplin wrote , directed , produced , edited , scored , and starred in most of his films .
He was a perfectionist , and his financial independence meant he often spent years on the development and production of a picture .
His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , and often feature the Tramp struggling against adversity .
Many contain social and political themes , as well as autobiographical elements .
In 1972 , as part of a renewed appreciation for his work , Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for `` the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century '' .
He continues to be held in high regard , with The Gold Rush , City Lights , Modern Times , and The Great Dictator often ranked among the greatest films of all time .
how does planned parenthood fund abortions ?
Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ) , commonly shortened to Planned Parenthood , is the U.S. affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) and one of its larger members .
PPFA is a non-profit organization providing reproductive health and maternal and child health services .
The Planned Parenthood Action Fund , Inc. ( PPAF ) is a related organization which lobbies for pro-choice legislation , comprehensive sex education , and access to affordable health care in the United States .
Planned Parenthood is the largest U.S. provider of reproductive health services , including cancer screening , HIV screening and counseling , contraception , and abortion .
Contraception accounts for 35 % of PPFA 's total services and abortions account for 3 % ; PPFA conducts roughly 300,000 abortions each year , among 3 million people served .
The organization has its roots in Brooklyn , New York , where Margaret Sanger opened the country 's first birth-control clinic .
Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921 , which in 1942 became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
Since then , Planned Parenthood has grown to have over 820 clinic locations in the U.S. , with a total budget of US $ 1 billion .
PPFA provides an array of services to over three million people in the United States , and supports services for over one million clients outside the United States .
What does the term `` mens rea '' mean
Mens rea is Latin for `` guilty mind '' .
In criminal law , it is viewed as one of the necessary elements of some crimes .
The standard common law test of criminal liability is usually expressed in the Latin phrase , actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea , which means `` the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty '' .
Thus , in jurisdictions with due process , there must be an actus reus , or `` guilty act , '' accompanied by some level of mens rea to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged ( see the technical requirement of concurrence ) .
As a general rule , criminal liability does not attach to a person who acted with the absence of mental fault .
The exception is strict liability crimes .
In civil law , it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort , for example .
However , if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached , such intent may increase the scope of liability as well as the measure of damages payable to the plaintiff .
Therefore , mens rea refers to the mental element of the offence that accompanies the actus reus .
In some jurisdictions , the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology .
In Australia , for example , the elements of the federal offences are now designated as `` fault elements '' or `` mental elements '' ( mens rea ) and `` physical elements '' or `` external elements '' ( actus reus ) .
This terminology was adopted to replace the obscurity of the Latin terms with simple and accurate phrasing .
what does s in ulysses s grant stand for
Ulysses S. Grant ( born Hiram Ulysses Grant ; April 27 , 1822 – July 23 , 1885 ) was the 18th President of the United States ( 1869–1877 ) following his highly successful role as a war general in the second half of the Civil War .
Under Grant , the Union Army defeated the Confederate military ; having effectively ended the war and secession with the surrender of Robert E. Lee 's army at Appomattox .
As president he led the Radical Republicans in their effort to eliminate all vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery .
Upset over uncontrolled violence in the South and having desired to protect African American citizenship , President Grant effectively destroyed the Ku Klux Klan in 1871 .
Grant was the first President to establish Civil Service reform having created a two-year federally funded Civil Service Commission in 1871 .
In terms of foreign policy , Grant revealed an `` unexpected capacity for deliberation and consultation '' that promoted the national interest .
His reputation was marred by his repeated defense of corrupt appointees , and by America 's first industrial age economic depression ( called the `` Panic of 1873 `` ) that dominated his second term .
Although his Republican Party split in 1872 with reformers denouncing him , Grant was easily reelected .
By 1875 the conservative white Southern opposition regained control of every state in the South and as he left the White House in March 1877 his policies were being undone .
A career soldier , he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and served in the Mexican–American War .
When the Civil War began in 1861 , Grant trained Union volunteer regiments in Illinois .
In 1862 , as a general he fought a series of battles and was promoted to major general after forcing the surrender of a large Confederate army and gaining control of Kentucky and most of Tennessee .
He then led Union forces to victory after initial setbacks in the Battle of Shiloh , earning a reputation as an aggressive commander .
In July 1863 , after a long , complex campaign , Grant defeated five uncoordinated Confederate armies ( capturing one of them ) and seized Vicksburg .
This famous victory gave the Union full control of the Mississippi River , split off the western Confederacy , and opened the way for more Union triumphs .
After another win at the Battle of Chattanooga in late 1863 , President Abraham Lincoln made him lieutenant general and commander of all of the Union Armies .
As commanding general of the army , Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of very bloody battles in 1864 known as the Overland Campaign that ended with the bottling up of Lee at Petersburg , outside the Confederate capital of Richmond .
During the siege , Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns launched by William Tecumseh Sherman , Philip Sheridan , and George Thomas .
Finally breaking through Lee 's trenches , the Union Army captured Richmond in April 1865 .
Lee surrendered his depleted forces to Grant at Appomattox as the Confederacy collapsed .
Although pro-Confederate historians attacked Grant as a ruthless butcher who won by brute force , most historians have hailed his military genius .
Grant 's two consecutive terms as President stabilized the nation after the American Civil War and during the turbulent Reconstruction period that followed .
As president , he enforced Reconstruction by enforcing civil rights laws and fighting Ku Klux Klan violence .
Grant won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment ; giving constitutional protection for African-American voting rights .
He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South , based on black voters , Northern newcomers ( `` Carpetbaggers `` ) and native white supporters ( `` Scalawags . '' )
As a result , African Americans were represented in the U.S. Congress for the first time in American history in 1870 .
Reformers praised Grant 's Indian peace policy by having broken the deadlock on Indian appropriations in Congress , the creation of the Board of Indian Commissioners to make reform recommendations , and his enlistment of Quaker Protestants who controlled mid western Indian agencies , that effectively curbed Congressional patronage .
Grant remained determined in keeping Indians from being exterminated from white settler encroachment or by the U.S. military .
Grant 's reputation as president by 1875 was at an all-time high for his previous veto of the Inflation Bill , the passage of the Resumption of Specie Act , and Secretary Bristow 's successful raids that shut down the Whiskey Ring .
Grant 's foreign policy , led by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , implemented International Arbitration , settled the Alabama Claims with Britain and avoided war with Spain over the Virginius Affair .

how many missions has the us sent to mars
Saturn V rocket , used for the American manned lunar landing missions
Space exploration is the discovery and exploration of outer space by means of space technology .
Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft .
While the observation of objects in space , known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality .
Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research , uniting different nations , ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries .
Various criticisms of space exploration are sometimes made .
Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War .
The early era of space exploration was driven by a `` Space Race `` between the Soviet Union and the United States , the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth , the USSR 's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957 , and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as the boundaries for this initial period .
The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones , including the first living being in orbit in 1957 , the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961 , the first spacewalk ( by Aleksei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965 , the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 , and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971 .
After the first 20 years of exploration , focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware , such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011 , plans for space exploration by the USA remain in flux .
Constellation , a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009 .
The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low earth orbit ( LEO ) , envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020 , transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector , and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO , such as Earth/Moon L1 , the Moon , Earth/Sun L2 , near-earth asteroids , and Phobos or Mars orbit .
As of March 2011 , the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards a compromise NASA funding bill , which will probably terminate Constellation and fund development of a heavy lift launch vehicle ( HLLV ) .
In the 2000s , the People 's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program , while the European Union , Japan , and India have also planned future manned space missions .
China , Russia , Japan , and India have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century , while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century .
From the 1990s onwards , private interests began promoting space tourism and then private space exploration of the Moon ( see Google Lunar X Prize ) .
how many terms did calvin coolidge serve
John Calvin Coolidge , Jr. ( July 4 , 1872January 5 , 1933 ) was the 30th President of the United States ( 1923–1929 ) .
A Republican lawyer from Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of that state .
His conduct during the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action .
Soon after , he was elected as the 29th Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 .
Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative , and also as a man who said very little .
Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity .
As a Coolidge biographer put it , `` He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions .
That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . ''
Some later criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of laissez-faire government .
His reputation underwent a renaissance during the Ronald Reagan Administration , but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government programs and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating and controlling the economy .
how much caffeine is in a shot of espresso
Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans .
Espresso often has a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods , a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids , and crema ( meaning cream , but being a reference to the foam with a creamy texture that forms as a result of the pressure ) .
As a result of the pressurized brewing process the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated .
Espresso is the base for other drinks , such as a latte , cappuccino , macchiato , mocha , or americano .
Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most beverages , but the usual serving size is smaller—a typical 60 mL ( 2 US fluid ounce ) of espresso has 80 to 150 mg of caffeine , little less than the 95 to 200 mg of a standard 240 mL ( 8 US fluid ounces ) cup of drip-brewed coffee .

how is a contract legally binding ?
A contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties , each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between them .
The elements of a contract are `` offer '' and `` acceptance '' by `` competent persons '' having legal capacity who exchange `` consideration '' to create `` mutuality of obligation . ''
Proof of some or all of these elements may be done in writing , though contracts may be made entirely orally or by conduct .
The remedy for breach of contract can be `` damages '' in the form of compensation of money or specific performance enforced through an injunction .
Both of these remedies award the party at loss the `` benefit of the bargain '' or expectation damages , which are greater than mere reliance damages , as in promissory estoppel .
The parties may be natural persons or juristic persons .
A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur .
The word promise can be used as a legal synonym for contract , although care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract , as when it is an agreement without consideration .
Contract law varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another , including differences in common law compared to civil law , the impact of received law , particularly from England in common law countries , and of law codified in regional legislation .
Regarding Australian Contract Law for example , there are 40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the Commonwealth ( Federal / national ) level , and an additional 26 acts at the level of the state of NSW .
In addition there are 6 international instruments or conventions which are applicable for international dealings , such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods .

Nicknamed `` The Next One `` , he was one of the most highly regarded draft picks in hockey history , leading many to refer to the 2005 Draft Lottery as the `` Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes '' .
In his first NHL season , Crosby finished sixth in league scoring with 102 points ( 39 goals , 63 assists ) and was a runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy ( won by Alexander Ovechkin ) .
By his second season , he led the NHL with 120 points ( 36 goals , 84 assists ) to capture the Art Ross Trophy , becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring title in any major North American sports league .

Four years later , Crosby was named to Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver .
Playing the United States in the gold medal game , he scored the game-winning goal in overtime .
what does add my two cents mean
A United States cent , also known as a penny .
`` My two cents '' ( 2¢ ) and its longer version `` put my two cents in '' is an United States ( US ) idiomatic expression , taken from the original English idiom expression : to put in `` my two pennies worth '' or `` my tuppence worth . ''
It is used to preface the tentative stating of one’s opinion .
By deprecating the opinion to follow – suggesting its value is only two cents , a very small amount – the user of the phrase hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly statement , showing politeness and humility .
However , it is also sometimes used with irony when expressing a strongly felt opinion .
The phrase is also used out of habit to preface uncontentious opinions .
For example:
what happened to kuomintang after the chinese civil war
The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the government of the Republic of China led by the Kuomintang ( KMT ) and forces of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) .
The war began in April 1927 , amidst the Northern Expedition , and essentially ended when major active battles ceased in 1950 .
The conflict eventually resulted in two de facto states , the Republic of China ( ROC ) in Taiwan and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in mainland China , both claiming to be the legitimate government of China .
The war represented an ideological split ( Left vs . Right ) between the Communist CPC , and the KMT 's brand of Nationalism .
The civil war continued intermittently until late 1937 , when the two parties formed a Second United Front to counter a Japanese invasion .
China 's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946 , a year after the end of hostilities with Japan .
After four more years , 1950 saw the cessation of major military hostilities—with the newly founded People 's Republic of China controlling mainland China ( including Hainan ) , and the Republic of China 's jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan , Penghu , Quemoy , Matsu and several outlying islands .
The Kuomintang defeat is attributed to several factors : Corruption - Chiang wrote in his diary on June 1948 that the KMT had failed , not because of external enemies but because of rot from within .
Strong initial support from the U.S. diminished , and then , stopped .
( Partly because of KMT corruption and anti-democratic regime , and partly because of the uncertain U.S. foreign policy towards Communism between 1945 and 1950 ) ; Communist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords .
This ensured PLA popular support .
After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II , Soviet forces turned over their captured Japanese weapons to the CPC and allowed the CPC to take control of territory in Manchuria .
To this day , no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed , and it is debated as to the whether the Civil War has legally ended .
Cross-Strait relations have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure , particularly over Taiwan 's political status , with both governments officially adhering to a `` One-China policy . ''
The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the Republic of Taiwan .
The ROC mutually claims mainland China , and they both continue the fight over diplomatic recognition .
Today , the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the form of cross-Strait relations ; however , the two separate de facto states have close economic ties .
how many representative in congress 2011
The One Hundred Twelfth United States Congress was the meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government , from January 3 , 2011 until January 3 , 2013 .
It convened in Washington , D.C. on January 3 , 2011 , and ended on January 3 , 2013 , 17 days before the end of the presidential term to which Barack Obama was elected in 2008 .
Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress .
This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census .
In the 2010 midterm elections , the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives .
While the Democrats kept their Senate majority , it was reduced from the previous Congress .
This was the first Congress in which the House and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress ( 2001–2003 ) , and the first Congress to begin that way since the 99th Congress ( 1985–1987 ) .
In this Congress , the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members , 242 , since the 80th Congress ( 1947–1949 ) .
It was also the first Congress since 1947 in which no member of the Kennedy family served , as well as the most politically polarized Congress since Reconstruction , with record low approval ratings .
how much total wealth in USA
Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities .
The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1945–2009 , unadjusted for inflation or population change .
For example , a household in possession of an $ 800,000 house , $ 5,000 in mutual funds , $ 30,000 in cars , $ 20,000 worth of stock in their own company , and a $ 45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $ 900,000 .
Assuming that this household would have a $ 250,000 mortgage , $ 40,000 in car loans , and $ 10,000 in credit card debt , its debts would total $ 300,000 .
Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household 's assets ( 900,000 - $ 300,000 = $ 600,000 ) , this household would have a net worth of $ 600,000 .
Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets .
The wealth —more specifically , the median net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race , education , geographic location and gender .
As one would expect , households with greater income feature the highest net worths , though high income can not be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth .
Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise , with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers .
In addition , wealth is unevenly distributed , with the wealthiest 25 % of US households owning 87 % of the wealth in the United States , which was $ 54.2 trillion in 2009 .
Including human capital such as skills , the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $ 118 trillion .
How will I feel after my Rhizotomy surgery ?
This article deals with Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) rather than the rhizotomy procedures for pain relief ; for those procedures , which have begun to take the name `` rhizotomy '' in certain instances , see facet rhizotomy and similar .
A rhizotomy ( ) is a term chiefly referring to a neurosurgical procedure that selectively destroys problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord , most often to relieve the symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy .
The selective dorsal rhizotomy ( SDR ) for spastic cerebral palsy has been the main use of rhizotomy for neurosurgeons specialising in spastic CP since the 1980s ; in this surgery , the spasticity-causing nerves are isolated and then targeted and destroyed .
The sensory nerve roots , where spasticity is located , are first separated from the motor ones , and the nerve fibres to be cut are then identified via electromyographic stimulation .
The ones producing spasticity are then selectively lesioned with tiny electrical pulses .
In spasticity , rhizotomy precisely targets and destroys the damaged nerves that don’t receive gamma amino butyric acid , which is the core problem for people with spastic cerebral palsy .
These over-firing , non-GABA-absorbing nerves generate unusual electrical activity during the EMG testing phase in SDR and are thus considered to be the source of the patient 's hypertonia ; they are eliminated with the electrical pulses once identified , while the remaining nerves and nerve routes carrying the correct messages remain fully intact and untouched .
This means that the spasticity is permanently dissolved , and that this is done without affecting nervous system sensitivity or function in other areas , because the only nerves destroyed are the over-firing ones responsible for the muscle tightness .
The terms rhizotomy and neurotomy are also increasingly becoming interchangeable in the treatment of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease .
This is a procedure called a facet rhizotomy and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing nerve root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body .
Such radio frequency nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed .
A facet rhizotomy is just one of many different forms of radiofrequency ablation , and its use of the `` rhizotomy '' name should not be confused with the SDR procedure .
what does a migrant worker do

how much of US 75 is 4 lane
U.S. Route 75 is a north–south U.S. Highway .
The highway 's northern terminus is in Kittson County , Minnesota , at the Canadian border , where it once continued as Manitoba Highway 75 on the other side of the now-closed border crossing .
Its southern terminus is at Interstate 30 and Interstate 45 in Dallas , Texas , where it is known as North Central Expressway .
U.S. 75 was a border-to-border route , from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston , Texas .
However , the entire segment south of Dallas , Texas has been decommissioned in favor of Interstate 45 , a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become State Highway 75 .
how did streets in lower 9th ward new orleans get their names
Lower Ninth Ward is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans .
As the name implies , it is part of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans .
The Lower Ninth Ward is often thought of as the entire area within New Orleans downriver of the Industrial Canal ; however , the City Planning Commission divides this area into the Lower Ninth Ward ( 2 ) and Holy Cross ( 3 ) neighborhoods .
The term `` Lower '' refers to its location farther towards the mouth of the Mississippi River , `` down '' or `` below '' the rest of the city in local geographic terminology .
But the 9th Ward , like all Wards in New Orleans , is a voting district .
The 9th Ward was added as a voting district in 1852 .
The `` lower '' 9th Ward is composed of Ward 9 Districts 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 which make up the Holy Cross Area and Ward 9 Districts 3 , 5 , 6 , and 8 .
Higher voting district numbers in the 9th Ward ( 8-27 ) are on the upriver side of the Industrial Canal .
The area came to national attention for its devastation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
how was the moon formed
Hubble views of Copernicus crater ( inset ) , which is about 58 miles ( 93 km ) wide
Red and orange tinted Moon , as seen from Earth during a lunar eclipse , where the Earth comes between the Moon and Sun
The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth , and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System .
It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27 % the diameter and 60 % the density of Earth , resulting in its mass .
The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter .
The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters .
It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark , with a reflectance similar to that of coal .
Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have , since ancient times , made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology .
The Moon 's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day .
The Moon 's current orbital distance , about thirty times the diameter of the Earth , causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun , allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses .
This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence .
The Moon 's linear distance from the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82±0.07cm per year , but this rate is not constant .
The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago , not long after the Earth .
Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past , the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars -sized body .
The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot .
The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the United States ' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date , beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968 , and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 , with the first being Apollo 11 .
These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon 's origins , the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history .
After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 , the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft , notably by the final Soviet Lunokhod rover .
Since 2004 , Japan , China , India , the United States , and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters .
These spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith .
Future manned missions to the Moon have been planned , including government as well as privately funded efforts .
The Moon remains , under the Outer Space Treaty , free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes .
what did ronald reagan do as president
Ronald Wilson Reagan ( ; February 6 , 1911 – June 5 , 2004 ) was the 40th President of the United States ( 1981–1989 ) .
Prior to that , he was the 33rd Governor of California ( 1967–1975 ) , and a radio , film and television actor .
Born in Tampico , Illinois , and raised in Dixon , Reagan was educated at Eureka College , earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology .
After graduating , Reagan moved first to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then , in 1937 , to Los Angeles where he began a career as an actor , first in films and later television .
Some of his most notable films include Knute Rockne , All American ( 1940 ) , Kings Row ( 1942 ) , and Bedtime for Bonzo ( 1951 ) .
Reagan served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and later as a spokesman for General Electric ( GE ) ; his start in politics occurred during his work for GE .
Originally a member of the Democratic Party , his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s , and he switched to the Republican Party in 1962 .
After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater 's presidential candidacy in 1964 , he was persuaded to seek the California governorship , winning two years later and again in 1970 .
He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976 , but won both the nomination and general election in 1980 , defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter .
As president , Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives .
His supply-side economic policies , dubbed `` Reaganomics `` , advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth , controlling the money supply to reduce inflation , deregulation of the economy , and reducing government spending .
In his first term he survived an assassination attempt , took a hard line against labor unions , announced a new War on Drugs , and ordered an invasion of Grenada .
He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 , proclaiming that it was `` Morning in America `` .
His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters , such as the ending of the Cold War , the 1986 bombing of Libya , and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair .
Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire `` , he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of détente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR .
Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of both countries ' nuclear arsenals .
Reagan left office in 1989 .
In 1994 , the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease earlier in the year ; he died ten years later at the age of 93 .
A conservative icon , he ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American political right .
how many verses does the chapter 21 of the book of joshua have according to the aleppo codex
Complete set of scrolls , constituting the entire Tanakh .
The Tanakh ( , or ; also Tenakh , Tenak , Tanach ) is a name used in Judaism for the canon of the Hebrew Bible .
The Tanakh is also known as the Masoretic Text or the Miqra .
The name is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the Masoretic Text 's three traditional subdivisions : The Torah ( `` Teaching '' , also known as the Five Books of Moses ) , Nevi'im ( `` Prophets '' ) and Ketuvim ( `` Writings '' ) —hence TaNaKh .
The name `` Miqra '' ( מקרא ) , meaning `` that which is read '' , is an alternative Hebrew term for the Tanakh .
The books of the Tanakh were relayed with an accompanying oral tradition passed on by each generation , called the Oral Torah .

how many presidents have been assassinated
Assassination attempts and plots on Presidents of the United States have been numerous : more than 20 attempts to kill sitting and former presidents , as well as the Presidents-elect , are known .
Four sitting presidents have been killed : Abraham Lincoln ( the 16th President ) , James A. Garfield ( the 20th President ) , William McKinley ( the 25th President ) and John F. Kennedy ( the 35th President ) .
Two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations : former President Theodore Roosevelt ( the 26th President ) , and President Ronald Reagan ( the 40th President ) .
Although the historian J.W . Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations were politically motivated actions , carried out by rational men , not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons .
Some attackers had questionable mental stability , and a few were judged legally insane .
Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century been elected from the same political party as the President , the assassination of the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes .
This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks .
what genre is where the red fern grows
Where the Red Fern Grows is a novel written by Wilson Rawls in 1961 about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhound hunting dogs .
what does oklahoma produce
Oklahoma ( ) ( Pawnee : Uukuhuúwa , Cayuga : Gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state located in West South Central United States .
Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States .
The state 's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma , meaning `` red people '' , and it is known informally by its nickname , The Sooner State .
Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16 , 1907 , Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union .
Its residents are known as Oklahomans or , informally `` Okies '' , and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City .
A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agriculture , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology .
It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation , ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth .
Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas .
With small mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S . Interior Highlands —a region especially prone to severe weather .
In addition to having a prevalence of English , German , Scottish , Irish and Native American ancestry , more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma , second only to California .
Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans .

how many decatherms in a therm
Natural Gas is usually measured by volume in the United States and is stated in cubic feet .
A cubic foot of gas is the amount of gas needed to fill a volume of one cubic foot under set conditions of pressure and temperature.To measure larger amounts of natural gas , a `` therm '' is used to denote 100 cubic feet , and `` mcf '' is used to denote 1,000 cubic feet .
To provide greater accuracy in comparing fuels , energy content is measured in terms of `` British Thermal Units ( BTU 's ) . ''
A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water ( approximately a pint ) , one degree Fahrenheit at or close to its point of maximum density .
One British therm ( symbol thm ) is a non- SI unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units ( BTU ) .
It is approximately the energy equivalent of burning 100 cubic feet ( often referred to as 1 CCF ) of natural gas .
Since ( Natural Gas ) meters measure volume and not energy content , a therm factor is used by ( Natural ) gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent , and thus calculate the actual energy use .
The therm factor is usually in the units therms/CCF .
It will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas .
Natural gas with a higher than average concentration of ethane , propane or butane will have a higher therm factor .
Impurities , such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen , lower the therm factor .
The volume of the gas is calculated as if measured at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) .
The heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas , and is independent of temperature and pressure .
One therm is equal to about 105.5 megajoules , 25,200 kilocalories or 29.3 kilowatt-hours .
One therm can also be provided by about of natural gas .
The therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie ( see below ) .
The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat .
A thermie ( th ) is a metric unit of heat energy , part of the meter-tonne-second system sometimes used by European engineers .
The thermie is equal to the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 tonne of water by 1 °C .
The thermie is equivalent to 1,000 kilocalories , 4.1868 megajoules or 3968.3 BTU .
what date did the american civil war start
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .

how does the e coli bacteria cause death
Escherichia coli ( ; commonly abbreviated E. coli ) is a Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms ( endotherms ) .
Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in humans , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination .
The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2 , and by preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine .
E. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1 % of gut flora , and fecal–oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease .
Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time , which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination .
There is , however , a growing body of research that has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside of the host .
The bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting , and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years .
E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism , and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology , where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA .
what area code is 217
Area code 217 is the North American telephone area code for much of western and central Illinois .
The 217 area includes Illinois ' capital , Springfield , plus Champaign , Urbana , Decatur , Danville , Quincy , and Rantoul .
217 was one of the original area codes , which were created in 1947 .
The only significant change in 217 's boundaries was in 1957 , when its northern portion was combined with part of area code 815 to form area code 309 .
what causes destruction of the ozone layer
Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever recorded ( September 2006 ) , over the Southern pole
Layers of the atmosphere ( not to scale )
Ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s : a steady decline of about 4 % per decade in the total volume of ozone in Earth 's stratosphere ( the ozone layer ) , and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth 's polar regions .
The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole .
In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena , there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events .
The details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning , but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens .
The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants ( CFCs , freons , halons ) .
These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface .
Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halo-carbons increased .
CFCs and other contributory substances are referred to as ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ) .
Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths ( 280–315 nm ) of ultraviolet light ( UV light ) from passing through the Earth 's atmosphere , observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol that bans the production of CFCs , halons , and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane .
It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences such as increases in skin cancer , cataracts , damage to plants , and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean 's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion .
what does it mean to form a more perfect union
The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution 's fundamental purposes and guiding principles .
It states in general terms , and courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of , the Founding Fathers ' intentions regarding the Constitution 's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve as it pertains to all of the people of the United States .
As the phrase , `` we the people '' suggests that the new government originates from the people of the United States and it sets into motion a question as it pertains to that vast population concerning the individual rights and equality among all people ; this can be seen most broadly in the divide between republicanism and social democracy .
how do i measure the shot put throw

The shot put ( pronounced ) is a track and field event involving `` throwing '' / '' putting '' ( throwing in a pushing motion ) a heavy spherical object —the shot—as far as possible .
The shot put competition for men has been a part of the modern Olympics since their revival in 1896 , women 's competition began in 1948 .
what countries belong with the united nations
Map of the United Nations ( UN ) member states , with their territories ( including dependent territories ) recognized by the UN in blue
There are United Nations ( UN ) member states , and each of them is a member of the United Nations General Assembly .
The criteria for admission of new members are set out in the United Nations Charter , Chapter II , Article 4:
A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council 's fifteen members , with none of the five permanent members voting against .
The Security Council 's recommendation must then be subsequently approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote .
In principle , only sovereign states can become UN members , and currently all UN members are sovereign states ( although a few members were not sovereign when they joined the UN ) .
Because a state can only be admitted to the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly , a number of states that may be considered sovereign states according to the Montevideo Convention criteria are not members because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty , mainly due to the lack of international recognition or opposition from certain members .
In addition to the member states , the UN also invites non-member states ( currently two : the Holy See and Palestine ) , intergovernmental organizations , and other international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty are not precisely defined , to become observers at the General Assembly , allowing them to participate and speak , but not vote , in General Assembly meetings .
what color is the eiffel tower
The Eiffel Tower ( , ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris , named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower .
Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World 's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world .
The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011 .
The third level observatory 's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the highest in Europe as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower , at , remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000 .
The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010 .
The tower stands tall , about the same height as an 81-storey building .
During its construction , the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years , until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930 .
Because of the addition , in 1957 , of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower , it is now taller than the Chrysler Building .
Not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in France , after the Millau Viaduct .
The tower has three levels for visitors .
Tickets can be purchased to ascend , by stairs or lift ( elevator ) , to the first and second levels .
The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps , as is the walk from the first to the second level .
The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public .
The first and second levels have restaurants .
The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France , often in the establishing shot of films set in the city .
How many consecutive games did Ken Jennings win ?
Kenneth Wayne `` Ken '' Jennings III ( born May 23 , 1974 ) is an American game show contestant and author .
Jennings is noted for holding the record for the longest winning streak on the U.S. syndicated game show Jeopardy !
and as being the all-time leading money winner on American game shows .
In 2004 , Jennings won 74 Jeopardy !
games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance .
His total earnings on Jeopardy !
are $ 3,172,700 , consisting of $ 2,520,700 over his 74 wins , a $ 2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance , a $ 500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy !
Ultimate Tournament of Champions , as well as half of a $ 300,000 prize in the IBM Challenge .
During his first run of Jeopardy !
appearances , Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings .
His total was surpassed by Brad Rutter , who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy !
Ultimate Tournament of Champions ( first aired on May 25 , 2005 ) , adding $ 2,000,000 to Rutter 's existing Jeopardy !
winnings .
Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows , culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ?
( first aired on October 10 , 2008 ) , though Rutter retains the Jeopardy !
record .
After his success on Jeopardy ! , Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac : Adventures in the Curious , Competitive , Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs , published in 2006 .
how old do you need to be to play professional football in the canadian league
The Canadian Football League or CFL ( ' [ LCF ] in French ) is a professional sports league located in Canada .
The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football , a form of gridiron football closely related to American football .
Its eight current teams , which are located in eight separate cities , are divided into two divisions of four teams each — the East Division and the West Division .
The league 's 19-week regular season runs from late June to early November ; each team plays 18 games with one bye week .
Following the regular season , the three teams with the best records in their division ( except if the fourth place team in one division has a better record than the third place team in the other division , when the team with the better record makes the playoffs and `` crosses over '' to the other division 's playoff ) compete in the league 's three-week divisional playoffs , which culminate in the late-November Grey Cup championship , the country 's largest annual sports and television event .
The CFL was officially founded on January 19 , 1958 , making it the second oldest gridiron football league in North America still in operation , although all its teams long predate the modern formation of the league .
It is the highest level of play in Canadian football , the most popular football league in Canada , and the second-most popular major sports league in Canada , after the National Hockey League .
Although ice hockey is Canada 's most popular sport , the CFL has increased the popularity of Canadian football in Quebec and Western Canada .
Canadian football is also played at amateur levels ( i.e . youth , high school , CJFL , QJFL , CIS and senior leagues such as the Alberta Football League ) .
The 2010s will be a significant decade for the CFL in terms of growth , as teams have renovated , expanded stadiums , or plan to build entirely new stadiums .
The Montreal Alouettes accomplished this first , adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in time for the 2010 CFL season .
The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated their respective stadiums and facilities for the 2010 season .
In 2011 , the BC Lions played under a new , retractable roof in BC Place after spending one and a half seasons at Empire Field .
Then the Winnipeg Blue Bombers will play in an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba , scheduled to open in time for the 2013 season .
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats , Saskatchewan Roughriders and the new Ottawa franchise are also looking at new or extensively-renovated stadiums in the following years .
There are also hopes of expanding the league to Atlantic Canada ( ideally basing a team in either the more populated Halifax , or the more centralized Moncton ) , as 2010 and 2011 had regular season games hosted in Moncton .
According to sports historian Douglas Brei , the Canadian Football League holds the distinction of being the only professional sports league in North America , major or minor league , in which each existing franchise has won at least one league title while in their current location .
what antibodies are produced in large quantities
Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key .
An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen .
Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision .
Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) .
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .
Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor ( BCR ) .
The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure .
In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding .
Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .
Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably .
Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .
There are several different types of antibody heavy chains , and several different kinds of antibodies , which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess .
Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals , which perform different roles , and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter .
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist .
This region is known as the hypervariable region .
Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity .
Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region .
This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system .
what happened to the zodiac killer
The symbol used by the Zodiac Killer to sign his correspondence
The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
The killer 's identity remains unknown .
The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia , Vallejo , Lake Berryessa , and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969 .
Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted .
The killer originated the name `` Zodiac '' in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press .
These letters included four cryptograms ( or ciphers ) .
Of the four cryptograms sent , only one has been definitively solved .
Suspects have been named by law enforcement and amateur investigators , but no conclusive evidence has surfaced .
In April 2004 , the San Francisco Police Department marked the case `` inactive '' , yet re-opened the case at some point prior to March 2007 .
The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo , as well as in Napa County and Solano County .
The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969 .

how does nanotechnology affect health
Nanotechnology ( sometimes shortened to `` nanotech '' ) is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale .
The earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology .
A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers .
This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold .
It is therefore common to see the plural form `` nanotechnologies '' as well as `` nanoscale technologies '' to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size .
Because of the variety of potential applications ( including industrial and military ) , governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research .
Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative , the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars .
The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars .
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , microfabrication , etc .
The associated research and applications are equally diverse , ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly , from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale .
Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology .
Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications , such as in medicine , electronics , biomaterials and energy production .
On the other hand , nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology , including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on global economics , as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios .
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .
what countries were depended on USSR after 1945
Map of the Eastern Bloc
The term Eastern Bloc or Communist Bloc refers to the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe , generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact .
The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union , although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe .
what day does election results for a new governor start in NJ
The New Jersey gubernatorial election of 2009 took place on November 3 , 2009 .
Democratic Governor Jon Corzine was running for a second term and was being challenged by Republican Chris Christie , Independent Christopher Daggett and nine others , in addition to several write-in candidates .
Christie won the election , with about 48.5 percent of the vote , to 44.9 percent for Corzine and 5.8 percent for Daggett .
Christie won the largest margin for a first term Republican since 1969 .
Christie assumed office on January 19 , 2010 .
This was the first election to fill the newly created office of Lieutenant Governor .
The candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were joined together as a single choice , so that voters did not have the opportunity to split the ticket .
Kim Guadagno , Christie 's running mate , became New Jersey 's first lieutenant governor following her inauguration .
how much does united states spend on health care
Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct organizations .
Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses .
Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government .
60-65 % of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare , Medicaid , TRICARE , the Children 's Health Insurance Program , and the Veterans Health Administration .
Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member 's employer , some buy health insurance on their own , and the remainder are uninsured .
Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013 , the United States was at or near the bottom in infant mortality , heart and lung disease , sexually transmitted infections , adolescent pregnancies , injuries , homicides , and rates of disability .
Together , such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the list for life expectancy .
On average , a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United States spent more on health care per capita ( $ 7,146 ) , and more on health care as percentage of its GDP ( 15.2 % ) , than any other nation in 2008 .
The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries , and notes U.S. care costs the most .
The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 49.9 million residents , 16.3 % of the population , were uninsured in 2010 ( up from 49.0 million residents , 16.1 % of the population , in 2009 ) .
A 2004 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report said : `` The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its population . ''
A 2004 OECD report said : `` With the exception of Mexico , Turkey , and the United States , all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal ( at least 98.4 % insured ) coverage of their populations by 1990 . ''
A 2010 report observed that lack of health insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States .
In 2007 , 62.1 % of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses .
A 2013 study found that about 25 % of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses , and 43 % are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence .
On March 23 , 2010 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) became law , providing for major changes in health insurance .
how much water is the human body made of
In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body .
A significant fraction of the human body is water .
Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight .
In a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life .
Also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' .
These figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology .
So there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure .
For example , Jackson 's ( 1985 ) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates Guyton 's 57 % .
In diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem .
Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide .
Per Netter 's Atlas of Human Physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments:
Intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .
Per Guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb .
Jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .
Extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .
Per Guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % Again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here .
Plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .
Per Guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres .
This amounts to 20 % , the same as per Netter 's Atlas .
Interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
Transcellular fluid ( a.k.a . `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )
Contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids .
what does low self esteem mean
Self-esteem is a term used in psychology to reflect a person 's overall emotional evaluation of his or her own worth .
It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self .
Self-esteem encompasses beliefs ( for example , `` I am competent , '' `` I am worthy '' ) and emotions such as triumph , despair , pride and shame .
Smith and Mackie define it by saying `` The self-concept is what we think about the self ; self-esteem , is the positive or negative evaluations of the self , as in how we feel about it . ''
Self-esteem is also known as the evaluative dimension of the self that includes feelings of worthiness , prides and discouragement .
One 's self-esteem is also closely associated with self-consciousness .
Self-esteem is a disposition that a person has which represents their judgements of their own worthiness .
In the mid-1960s , Morris Rosenberg and social-learning theorists defined self-esteem as a personal worth or worthiness .
Nathaniel Branden in 1969 defined self-esteem as `` the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness . ''
According to Branden , self-esteem is the sum of self-confidence ( a feeling of personal capacity ) and self-respect ( a feeling of personal worth ) .
It exists as a consequence of the implicit judgement that every person has of their ability to face life 's challenges , to understand and solve problems , and their right to achieve happiness , and be given respect .
As a social psychological construct , self-esteem is attractive because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of relevant outcomes , such as academic achievement ( Marsh 1990 ) or exercise behavior ( Hagger et al . 1998 ) .
In addition , self-esteem has also been treated as an important outcome due to its close relation with psychological well-being ( Marsh 1989 ) .
Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension ( for example , `` I believe I am a good writer and I feel happy about that '' ) or a global extent ( for example , `` I believe I am a bad person , and feel bad about myself in general '' ) .
Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic ( `` trait '' self-esteem ) , though normal , short-term variations ( `` state '' self-esteem ) also exist .
Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include : self-worth , self-regard , self-respect , and self-integrity .
what does it take to start a lodge in freemason
A Masonic Lodge , often termed a Private Lodge or Constituent Lodge , is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry .
Every new Lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge , but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published Constitution of the jurisdiction .
By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world 's first known Grand Lodge in London ( today called the United Grand Lodge of England ) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial i.e . without such warrant ; only one other lodge operates without a warrant - this is the Grand Stewards ' Lodge in London , although it is not also entitled to the `` time immemorial '' title .
A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge , in any jurisdiction ( i.e . under any Grand Lodge ) in amity with his own .
In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons ( that is , Freemasons who have attained the Order 's third degree ) .
He is first usually required to check , and certify , the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge - and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership .
Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice , Fellowcraft and Master Mason .

how does black pepper grow
Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning .
The fruit , known as a peppercorn when dried , is approximately in diameter , dark red when fully mature , and , like all drupes , contains a single seed .
Peppercorns , and the ground pepper derived from them , may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper ( cooked and dried unripe fruit ) , green pepper ( dried unripe fruit ) and white pepper ( dried ripe seeds ) .
Black pepper is native to south India , and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions .
Currently Vietnam is the world 's largest producer and exporter of pepper , producing 34 % of the world 's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008 .
Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavour and as a medicine .
Black pepper is the world 's most traded spice .
It is one of the most common spices added to European cuisine and its descendants .
The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine , not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs .
It is in the modern world , often paired with salt .
how frequent do you inspect hydrants
Fire hydrant in Charlottesville , Virginia , USA
A fire hydrant ( also known colloquially as a fire plug in the United States or as a johnny pump in New York City ) , is an active fire protection measure , and a source of water provided in most urban , suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire .
Buildings near a hydrant may qualify for an insurance discount since firefighters should be able to more rapidly extinguish a fire on the insured property .
The concept of fire plugs dates to at least the 17th century .
This was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight fires .
The water would fill the hole creating a temporary well , and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or , later , by hand-pumped fire engines .
The holes were then plugged with stoppers , normally redwood , which over time came to be known as fire plugs .
The location of the plug would often be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future fires .
This is the source of the colloquial term fire plug still used for fire hydrants today .
After the Great Fire of London in 1666 , the city installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals , equipped with risers , allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street level .
The invention of a post- or pillar-type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr. , Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801 .
It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of `` wet barrel '' design with the valve in the top .
It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant , but this can not be verified because the patent office in Washington D.C. caught on fire in 1836 destroying many patent records from that period in the process .
how south african leaders are elected
The President of the Republic of South Africa is the head of state and head of government under South Africa 's Constitution .
From 1961 to 1994 , the head of state was called the State President .
The President is elected by members of the National Assembly , the lower house of Parliament , and is usually the leader of the largest party , which has been the African National Congress since the first non-racial elections were held on 27 April 1994 .
The role was originally founded to be distinct from the now defunct role of prime minister , but the two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which specified a four-year term of office .
The 1993 and later constitutions limits the president 's time in office to two five-year terms .
The first President to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela , and the incumbent president is Jacob Zuma .
Under the interim Constitution ( valid from 1994 to 1996 ) , there was a Government of National Unity , in which an MP from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as Deputy President .
Along with Thabo Mbeki , the last State President , F.W . De Klerk also served as Deputy President , in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new Parliament .
But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party .
A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution ( adopted in 1996 ) , although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president .
how school librarians support students with disabilities in europe
Special education or special needs education is the education of students with special needs in a way that addresses the students ' individual differences and needs .
Ideally , this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures , adapted equipment and materials , accessible settings , and other interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and community than would be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education .
Common special needs include challenges with learning , communication challenges , emotional and behavioral disorders , physical disabilities , and developmental disorders .
Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching , use of technology , a specifically adapted teaching area , or resource room .
Intellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs , but the term `` special education '' is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students whose special needs reduce their ability to learn independently or in an ordinary classroom , and gifted education is handled separately .
In most developed countries , educators are modifying teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments .
Special education in developed countries is often regarded less as a `` place '' and more as `` a range of services , available in every school . ''
Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students .
The opposite of special education is general education .
General education is the standard curriculum presented with standard teaching methods and without additional supports .
what does the name `` soros '' mean ?
George Soros ( or ; ; ; born August 12 , 1930 , as Schwartz György ) is a Hungarian-American business magnate , investor , and philanthropist .
He is the chairman of Soros Fund Management .
Soros supports progressive-liberal causes .
He is known as `` The Man Who Broke the Bank of England `` because of his in investment profits during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis .
Between 1979 and 2011 , Soros gave away over $ 8 billion to human rights , public health , and education causes .
He played a significant role in the peaceful transition from communism to capitalism in Hungary ( 1984–89 ) and provided one of Europe 's largest higher education endowments to Central European University in Budapest .
Soros is also the chairman of the Open Society Institute .
how was the phone invented
An actor portraying Alexander Graham Bell speaking into an early model telephone .
The invention of the telephone is the culmination of work done by many individuals , the history of which involves a collection of claims and counterclaims .
The development of the modern electrical telephone involved an array of lawsuits founded upon the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies .
This article covers the early years from 1844 to 1898 , from conception of the idea of an electric voice-transmission device , to failed attempts to use `` make-and-break '' current , to successful experiments with electromagnetic telephones by Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson , and finally to commercially successful telephones in the late 19th century .
what can i do with a masters of fine arts degree
A Master of Fine Arts ( MFA , M.F.A . ) is a graduate degree typically requiring 2–3 years of postgraduate study beyond the bachelor 's degree ( BFA ) , although the term of study will vary by country or by university .
The MFA is a creative degree usually awarded as a terminal degree in visual arts , creative writing , filmmaking , dance , or theatre and other performing arts .
Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a major work or performance .
Master of Fine Arts programs have generally required a bachelor 's degree prior to admission , but many do not require that the undergraduate major be the same as the MFA field of study .
The most important admissions requirement has often been a sample portfolio or a performance audition .
The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA , while an academic program , centers around practice in the particular field , whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly , academic , or critical study of the field .
Additionally , in the United States , an MFA is recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of Visual Art , Design , Dance , Theatre , Film/Video , New Media , and Creative Writing - meaning that it is considered to be the highest degree in its field , and is used as a minimum qualification to be able to apply to become a Full-Time Professor teaching at the University level in these disciplines .
There are exceptions to this standard in the Arts , notably in the case of music performance , where the MFA is not seen as a terminal degree in the context of the more standardized DMA degree .
It is also critical to note that in the interest of extending the connection between creative production and continued academic research , some universities have established practice-based Ph.D programs in fields such as creative writing , visual arts , new media , design and theater .
While this has had an effect in Creative Writing , and to a lesser extent in design and new media , the influx of graduates from practice-based PhD programs has not appreciably changed the standard for the MFA as the terminal degree in most Arts disciplines yet .
This is an ongoing contentious topic , and is the frequent subject of academic panels , especially at the annual College Art Association conference .
The CAA 2008 guidelines regarding the MFA strongly re-affirms that the PhD is not required as a terminal degree in the visual arts .
how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki
The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945 .
The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date .
Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities , the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan .
The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May , but the Pacific War continued .
Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945 , threatening Japan with `` prompt and utter destruction '' .
The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum , and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project .
American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 , followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August .
Within the first two to four months of the bombings , the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki , with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day .
The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that , of the people who died on the day of the explosion , 60 % died from flash or flame burns , 30 % from falling debris and 10 % from other causes .
During the following months , large numbers died from the effect of burns , radiation sickness , and other injuries , compounded by illness .
In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death , 15–20 % died from radiation sickness , 20–30 % from burns , and 50–60 % from other injuries , compounded by illness .
In both cities , most of the dead were civilians , although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison .
On 15 August , six days after the bombing of Nagasaki , Japan announced its surrender to the Allies , signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September , officially ending World War II .
The bombings led , in part , to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament .
The role of the bombings in Japan 's surrender and their ethical justification are still debated .
how did mohammed gandhi die
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948 ) , commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi , was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India .
Employing non-violent civil disobedience , Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence , civil rights and freedom across the world .
The son of a senior government official , Gandhi was born and raised in a Hindu Bania community in coastal Gujarat , and trained in law in London .
Gandhi became famous by fighting for the civil rights of Muslim and Hindu Indians in South Africa , using new techniques of non-violent civil disobedience that he developed .
Returning to India in 1915 , he set about organising peasants to protest excessive land-taxes .
A lifelong opponent of `` communalism `` ( i.e . basing politics on religion ) he reached out widely to all religious groups .
He became a leader of Muslims protesting the declining status of the Caliphate .
Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , increasing economic self-reliance , and above all for achieving Swaraj —the independence of India from British domination .
Gandhi led Indians in protesting the national salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in demanding the British to immediately Quit India in 1942 , during World War II .
He was imprisoned for that and for numerous other political offenses over the years .
Gandhi sought to practice non-violence and truth in all situations , and advocated that others do the same .
He saw the villages as the core of the true India and promoted self-sufficiency ; he did not support the industrialization programs of his disciple Jawaharlal Nehru .
He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl , woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha .
His chief political enemy in Britain was Winston Churchill , who ridiculed him as a `` half-naked fakir . ''
He was a dedicated vegetarian , and undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and political mobilization .
In his last year , unhappy at the partition of India , Gandhi worked to stop the carnage between Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs that raged in the border area between India and Pakistan .
He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India 's Muslims .
30 January is observed as Martyrs ' Day in India .
The honorific Mahatma ( `` Great Soul '' ) was applied to him by 1914 .
In India he was also called Bapu ( `` Father '' ) .
He is known in India as the Father of the Nation ; his birthday , 2 October , is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti , a national holiday , and world-wide as the International Day of Non-Violence .
Gandhi 's philosophy was not theoretical but one of pragmatism , that is , practicing his principles in the moment .
Asked to give a message to the people , he would respond , `` My life is my message . ''
how did Joan Crawford die ?
Joan Crawford ( March 23 , ca . 1904 – May 10 , 1977 ) , born Lucille Fay LeSueur , was an American actress in film , television and theatre .
Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway , Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 .
Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts , Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a flapper by the end of the 1920s .
In the 1930s , Crawford 's fame rivaled , and later outlasted , MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo .
Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success .
These `` rags-to-riches '' stories were well received by Depression -era audiences and were popular with women .
Crawford became one of Hollywood 's most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States , but her films began losing money and by the end of the 1930s she was labeled `` box office poison '' .
After an absence of nearly two years from the screen , Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred Pierce ( 1945 ) , for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress .
In 1955 , she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman Alfred Steele .
After his death in 1959 , Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forcibly retired in 1973 .
She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s , when her performances became fewer ; after the release of the British horror film Trog in 1970 , Crawford retired from the screen .
Following a public appearance in 1974 , after which unflattering photographs were published , Crawford withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977 .
Crawford married four times .
Her first three marriages ended in divorce ; the last ended with the death of husband Alfred Steele .
She adopted five children , one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother .
Crawford 's relationships with her two older children , Christina and Christopher , were acrimonious .
Crawford disinherited the two and , after Crawford 's death , Christina wrote a `` tell-all '' memoir , Mommie Dearest , in which she alleged a lifelong pattern of physical and emotional abuse perpetrated by Crawford .
She was voted the tenth greatest female star in the history of American cinema by the American Film Institute .

what does doug 's father in law say about vegas before he leaves the hangover
The Hangover is a 2009 American comedy film , co-produced and directed by Todd Phillips and written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore .
It is the first film of The Hangover franchise .The film stars Bradley Cooper , Ed Helms , Zach Galifianakis , Heather Graham , Justin Bartha , and Jeffrey Tambor .
The Hangover tells the story of Phil Wenneck , Stu Price and Alan Garner , who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate their friend Doug Billings ' impending marriage .
However , Phil , Stu and Alan have no memory of the previous night 's events and must find Doug before the wedding can take place .
Lucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender 's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club .
After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $ 2 million , Philips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser , and also including boxer Mike Tyson .
Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days , and during filming , the three main actors ( Cooper , Helms and Galifianakis ) formed a friendship .
The Hangover was released on June 5 , 2009 , becoming a critical and commercial success .
It became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009 , with a worldwide gross of over US $ 467 million .
Critics praised the film 's comedic approach but criticized it for its vulgarity .
The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy , and received multiple other accolades .
It is the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009 in the world , as well as the second highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States , surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25 years and later being surpassed by Ted in 2012 .
Out of all R-rated films , it is the third highest-grossing ever in the U.S. , behind only The Passion of the Christ and The Matrix Reloaded .
A sequel , The Hangover Part II , was released in 2011 , and a third and final film , The Hangover Part III , is set for release in 2013 .
how many cells are produced during the cell cycle
Events involving meiosis , showing chromosomal crossover
Meiosis ( ) is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes .
The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores .
In many organisms , including all animals and land plants ( but not some other groups such as fungi ) , gametes are called sperm and egg cells .
Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle ' cell division process of mitosis , it differs in two important respects:
the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete , compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome ( one received from each parent ) in each cell which results from mitosis .
the outcome of meiosis is potentially four ( genetically unique ) haploid cells , compared with the two ( genetically identical ) diploid cells produced from mitosis .
Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organism 's mother and one from its father .
The cell divides twice , potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome .
( `` Potentially '' because in some cases , such as the formation of oocytes in mammals , only one of the possible four haploid cells survives . )
In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete .
Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA , resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent .
This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations .
This genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which natural selection can act , but , as described below in Section 6 , Origin and function of meiosis , the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis .
It is also noteworthy that during meiosis , specific genes are more highly transcribed , and these are called the meiome , the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome .
Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing , synapse and recombination occur .
In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA ( the meiome ) , however , there are also pervasive translational controls ( e.g . selective usage of preformed mRNA ) , regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis .
Thus , both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis .
Prior to the meiosis process the cell 's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication , creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome ( homologs ) two exact copies , sister chromatids , attached at the centromere region .
In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other .
Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome .
Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator .
Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell .
As the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells , each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids .
After the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells , a second round of cell division occurs .
There meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells .
Upon fertilization , for example when a sperm enters an egg cell , two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse .
The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offspring 's genome .
Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis , a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells .
In all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores : haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization .
how many rounds in boxing
Boxing ( pugilism , prize fighting , the sweet science or in Greek pygmachia ) is a martial art and combat sport in which two people engage in a contest of strength , speed , reflexes , endurance and will by throwing punches with gloved hands .
Amateur boxing is an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most of the major international games - it also has its own World Championships .
Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds .
The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee , is disqualified for breaking a rule , resigns by throwing in a towel , or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest .
The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC .
Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century , again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States .
In 2004 , ESPN ranked boxing as the most difficult sport in the world .
how does agreement show grammatical relation
Agreement or concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates .
It is an instance of inflection , and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category ( such as gender or person ) `` agree '' between different words or parts of the sentence .
For example , in Standard English , one may say I am or he is , but not `` I is '' or `` he am '' .
This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its subject agree in person .
The pronouns I and he are first and third person respectively , as are the verb forms am and is .
The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject .
The agreement based on overt grammatical categories as above is formal agreement , in contrast to notional agreement , which is based on meaning .
For instance , the phrase The United States is treated as singular for purposes of agreement , even though it is formally plural .

how was a lawyer called in latin
A lawyer , according to Black 's Law Dictionary , is `` a person learned in the law ; as an attorney , counsel or solicitor ; a person who is practicing law . ''
Law is the system of rules of conduct established by the sovereign government of a society to correct wrongs , maintain the stability of political and social authority , and deliver justice .
Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems , or to advance the interests of those who retain ( i.e. , hire ) lawyers to perform legal services .
The role of the lawyer varies significantly across legal jurisdictions , and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms .

what does the family leave act
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ( FMLA ) is a United States federal law requiring covered employers to provide employees job-protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons .
Qualified medical and family reasons include : personal or family illness , family military leave , pregnancy , adoption , or the foster care placement of a child .
The FMLA is administered by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor .
The bill was a major part of President Bill Clinton 's agenda in his first term .
President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 5 , 1993 ( ; 29 U.S.C . sec . 2601 ; 29 CFR 825 ) and it took effect on August 5 , 1993 , six months later .
The FMLA was intended `` to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families . ''
The Act allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to attend to the serious health condition of the employee , parent , spouse or child , or for pregnancy or care of a newborn child , or for adoption or foster care of a child .
In order to be eligible for FMLA leave , an employee must have been at the business at least 12 months , and worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months , and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles .
The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees , but certain categories of employees are excluded , including elected officials and their personal staff members .
how did the vietnam war end
The Vietnam War ( ) was a Cold War -era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 .
This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam , supported by its communist allies , and the government of South Vietnam , supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries .
The Viet Cong ( also known as the National Liberation Front , or NLF ) , a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist common front directed by the North , largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region .
The Vietnam People 's Army ( North Vietnamese Army ) engaged in a more conventional war , at times committing large units into battle .
U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations , involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes .
The U.S. government viewed involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment .
The North Vietnamese government and Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam under communist rule .
They viewed the conflict as a colonial war , fought initially against France , backed by the U.S. , and later against South Vietnam , which it regarded as a U.S. puppet state .
American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina beginning in 1950 .
U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with troop levels tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962 .
U.S. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965 .
Operations spanned international borders , with Laos and Cambodia heavily bombed .
American involvement in the war peaked in 1968 , at the time of the Tet Offensive .
After this , U.S. ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as Vietnamization .
Despite the Paris Peace Accords , signed by all parties in January 1973 , fighting continued .
U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the Case–Church Amendment passed by the U.S. Congress .
The capture of Saigon by the Vietnam People 's Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war , and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year .
The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities ( see Vietnam War casualties ) .
Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 800,000 to 3.1 million .
Some 200,000–300,000 Cambodians , 20,000–200,000 Laotians , and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict .
how do you know if a volcano is extinct
Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006 .
Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km during the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo , Philippines in 1991 .
A volcano is an opening , or rupture , in a planet 's surface or crust , which allows hot magma , volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface .
Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging .
A mid-oceanic ridge , for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart ; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together .
By contrast , volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .
Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth 's crust in the interiors of plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift , the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America .
This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of `` Plate hypothesis '' volcanism .
Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes .
These so-called `` hotspots `` , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth .
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards , not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption .
Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft , in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature .
Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth 's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however , they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth , thereby warming the stratosphere .
Historically , so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines .
How is the pothole formed
A deep pothole on New York City 's Second Avenue
A pothole ( sometimes called a kettle and known in parts of the Western United States as a chuckhole ) is a type of disruption in the surface of a roadway where a portion of the road material has broken away , leaving a hole .
how much more time does chemo give to people with renal cancer
Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC , also known as hypernephroma ) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule , the very small tubes in the kidney that transport GF ( glomerular filtrate ) from the glomerulus to the descending limb of the nephron .
RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults , responsible for approximately 80 % of cases .
It is also known to be the most lethal of all the genitourinary tumors .
Initial treatment is most commonly a radical or partial nephrectomy and remains the mainstay of curative treatment .
Where the tumor is confined to the renal parenchyma , the 5-year survival rate is 60-70 % , but this is lowered considerably where metastases have spread .
It is relatively resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy , although some cases respond to immunotherapy .
Targeted cancer therapies such as sunitinib , temsirolimus , bevacizumab , interferon-alpha , and sorafenib have improved the outlook for RCC .

what does peritoneal cavity hold
The peritoneum ( ) is the serous membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity or the coelom —it covers most of the intra-abdominal ( or coelomic ) organs—in amniotes and some invertebrates ( annelids , for instance ) .
It is composed of a layer of mesothelium supported by a thin layer of connective tissue .
The peritoneum both supports the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood and lymph vessels and nerves .
The abdominal cavity ( the space bounded by the vertebrae , abdominal muscles , diaphragm and pelvic floor ) should not be confused with the intraperitoneal space ( located within the abdominal cavity , but wrapped in peritoneum ) .
The structures within the intraperitoneal space are called `` intraperitoneal '' ( e.g . the stomach ) , the structures in the abdominal cavity that are located behind the intraperitoneal space are called `` retroperitoneal `` ( e.g . the kidneys ) , and those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called `` subperitoneal '' or `` infraperitoneal '' ( e.g . the bladder ) .
how does a solid state drive work
Modern 2.5 '' SSD used in consumer laptops and desktop computers .
DDR SDRAM based SSD .
Max and .
PCI attached IO Accelerator SSD
PCI-E , DRAM , and NAND based SSD .
It uses an external power supply to make the DRAM non-volatile .
A solid-state drive ( SSD ) ( also known as a solid-state disk or electronic disk , though it contains no actual `` disk '' of any kind ) is a data storage device using integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently .
SSD technology uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block input/output ( I/O ) hard disk drives .
SSDs have no moving mechanical components , which distinguish them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives ( HDDs ) or floppy disks , which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads .
Compared with electromechanical disks , SSDs are typically less susceptible to physical shock , much quieter , have lower access time , and less latency .
However , while the price of SSDs has continued to decline in 2012 , SSDs are still about 7 to 8 times more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs .
Many SSDs use I/O interfaces developed for hard disk drives , thus permitting simple replacement in common applications .
, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory , which retains data without power .
For applications requiring fast access , but not necessarily data persistence after power loss , SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory ( RAM ) .
Such devices may employ separate power sources , such as batteries , to maintain data after power loss .
Hybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives ( SSHD ) combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit , containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data .
These devices may offer near-SSD performance for many applications .
how do they harvest caviar ?
Salmon roe ( left ) and sturgeon caviar ( right ) served with mother of pearl caviar spoons to avoid tainting the taste of the caviar .
Ossetra caviar , salmon creme fraiche , potato shallot croquette , basil oil , egg whites and yolks
Caviar , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization , is a product made from salt-cured fish-eggs of the Acipenseridae family .
The roe can be `` fresh '' ( non-pasteurized ) or pasteurized , with pasteurization reducing its culinary and economic value .
Traditionally the term caviar refers only to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian and Black Seas ( Beluga , Ossetra and Sevruga caviars ) .
Depending on the country , caviar may also be used to describe the roe of other fish such as salmon , steelhead , trout , lumpfish , whitefish , and other species of sturgeon .
Caviar is considered a luxury delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or a spread .
In 2012 , caviar sold for $ 2,500 per pound , or $ 3,000 to $ 5,500 per kilo .
what channel is sec network ?
The SEC Network is a television syndication network featuring live broadcasts of college football and basketball events from the Southeastern Conference .
It is owned and operated by ESPN Plus and is shown in more than 50 percent of households in the United States , mostly Southeastern United States markets .
The SEC Network typically airs in the noon eastern slot that was former home to the Raycom Sports SEC game of the week .
Games are shown locally on broadcast stations , regional sports networks , as well as on ESPN GamePlan , ESPN Full Court , and ESPN3.com .
The SEC Network is also available in Canada via Atlanta 's WPCH-TV .
The SEC Network uses the same on-screen graphics currently used by ESPN on ABC , a version of ESPN 's graphics package .
SEC Network 's football programming still uses a title safe area because most of its affiliates do not Letterbox their Standard Definition feeds , while ESPN 's television networks have allowed their graphics to abandon the title safe , but letterbox for SD viewers .
Starting with the SEC 2012 Basketball season , SEC Network 's graphics have been converted to a 16:9 Widescreen-only format .
This is also being used for the 2013 Basketball season , but had still adapted the former 4:3-safe graphics format for the 2012 SEC football season .
what happened in the 90 's
The 1990s , pronounced and also known as `` the Nineteen-Nineties '' or abbreviated as `` the Nineties '' or `` the '90s '' , was a decade that began on January 1 , 1990 , and ended on December 31 , 1999 .
It was the 10th and last decade of the 20th century and the 100th and last decade of the 2nd millennium .
The decade is best known for the end of the Cold War at the beginning of the decade and the expansion and commercialization of the Internet during the second half of the decade .
In much of the West the 1990s is remembered as a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity , though many parts of the so-called Third World faced various problems including genocide , AIDS and new or continuing ethnic tensions and civil wars .
Culturally speaking the decade was characterized by the rise of multiculturalism and alternative media .
Movements such as grunge , the rave scene and hip hop spread around the world to young people during the decade , aided by then-new technology such as cable television and the Internet .
A combination of factors , including the mass mobilization of capital markets through neoliberalism , the beginning of the widespread proliferation of new media such as the Internet , and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power across the world , and within countries .
Income inequality among countries in the world rose sharply between the 1980s and the mid-1990s , before levelling off and then falling after 2000 .
New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa , the Balkans and the Caucasus , the former two which led to the Rwandan genocide and Bosnian genocide , respectively .
The United States began its current military occupation of the Middle East during the summer of 1990 with Desert Shield after it cut off a large portion of the world 's petroleum supply .
Signs of any resolution of tensions between Israel and the Arab world remained elusive , though the Irish Troubles came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement after 30 years of violence .
How many Gray Wolves are in the world
The gray wolf or grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) is a species of canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America , Eurasia , and North Africa .
It is the largest member of its family , with males averaging , and females .
It is similar in general appearance and proportions to a German shepherd , or sled dog , but has a larger head , narrower chest , longer legs , straighter tail and bigger paws .
Its winter fur is long and bushy , and predominantly a mottled gray in colour , although nearly pure white , red , or brown to black also occur .
Within the genus Canis , the gray wolf represents a more specialised and progressive form than its smaller cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ) , as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey , its more gregarious nature and its highly advanced expressive behavior .
It is a social animal , travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring .
The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range , with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it .
It feeds primarily on large ungulates , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage .
The gray wolf is one of the world 's most well researched animals , with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species .
It has a long history of association with humans , having been despised and hunted in most agricultural communities due to its attacks on livestock , while conversely being respected by some Native American tribes .
It is the sole ancestor of the dog , which was first domesticated in the Middle East .
Although the fear of wolves is prevalent in many human societies , the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies .
Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people , mainly children , but this is unusual , as wolves are relatively few , live away from people , and have been taught to fear humans by hunters and shepherds .
Hunting and trapping has reduced the species ' range to , though its still relatively widespread range and stable population means that the species is not threatened at a global level , and is therefore classified by the IUCN as Least Concern .
how long did the roman empire last
The Roman Empire ( ) was the post- Republican period of the ancient Roman civilization , characterised by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean in Europe , Africa , and Asia .
The 500-year-old Roman Republic , which preceded it , had been destabilized through a series of civil wars .
Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire , including Julius Caesar 's appointment as perpetual dictator ( 44 BC ) ; the Battle of Actium ( 31 BC ) ; and the granting of the honorific Augustus to Octavian by the Roman Senate ( 27 BC ) .
The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ) .
It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of Trajan ( 98–117 AD ) .
In the 3rd century , the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence , but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors Aurelian and Diocletian .
Christians rose to power in the 4th century , during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the Latin West and Greek East .
After the collapse of central government in the West in the 5th century , the eastern half continued as what would later be known as the Byzantine Empire .
Because of the Empire 's vast extent and long endurance , the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language , religion , architecture , philosophy , law , and forms of government in the territory it governed , particularly Europe , and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world .
how many high schools are in the us
Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public sector , with control and funding coming from three levels : local , state , and federal , in that order .
Child education is compulsory , and there are also a large number and wide variety of higher education institutions throughout the country that one can choose to attend , both publicly and privately administered .
Public education is universally available .
School curricula , funding , teaching , employment , and other policies are set through locally elected school boards with jurisdiction over school districts with many directives from state legislatures .
School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions , with independent officials and budgets .
Educational standards and standardized testing decisions are usually made by state governments .
The ages for compulsory education vary by state .
It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to eighteen .
Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public schools , state-certified private schools , or an approved home school program .
In most public and private schools , education is divided into three levels : elementary school , middle school ( sometimes called junior high school ) , and high school ( sometimes referred to as secondary education ) .
In almost all schools at these levels , children are divided by age groups into grades , ranging from kindergarten ( followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school , up to twelfth grade , the final year of high school .
The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area .
Post-secondary education , better known as `` college `` in the United States , is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system , and is described in a separate section below .
Government supported , free public schools for all started being established after the revolution , and expanded in the 19th century , as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann and Booker T. Washington .
By 1870 , all states had free elementary schools , albeit only in urban centers .
As the 20th century drew nearer , states started passing laws to make schooling compulsory , and by 1910 , 72 percent of children attended school .
Private schools continued to spread during this time , as well as colleges and—in the rural centers— land grant colleges .
The year of 1910 also saw the first true high schools .
During the rest of the 20th century , educational efforts centered on reducing the inequality of the schooling system .
The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education made the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority , while the Pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college .
Special education was made into federal law in 1975 .
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement , and in 1983 , a commission was established to evaluate their results and propose a course of action .
The resulting No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic .
A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education , but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented .

how much does U.S. pay on health care per person
Health spending per capita , in $ US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations .
Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States are often made by government , public health and public policy analysts .
The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s .
The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada , on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP .
In 2006 , per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US $ 3,678 ; in the U.S. , US $ 6,714 .
The U.S. spent 15.3 % of GDP on health care in that year ; Canada spent 10.0 % .
In 2006 , 70 % of health care spending in Canada was financed by government , versus 46 % in the United States .
Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23 % higher than Canadian government spending , and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83 % of total Canadian spending ( public and private ) though these statistics do n't take into account population differences .
Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending .
A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States , but differences are not consistent . ''
Life expectancy is longer in Canada , and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S. , but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences .
One commonly cited comparison , the 2000 World Health Organization 's ratings of `` overall health service performance '' , which used a `` composite measure of achievement in the level of health , the distribution of health , the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution '' , ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations .
This study rated the US `` responsiveness '' , or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment , as 1st , compared with 7th for Canada .
While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US , simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior .
The WHO 's study methods were criticized by some analyses .
Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care , assuming the population makeup is similar , a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the `` difficult research issues '' facing international comparisons .
what creates sonic boom
The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier , and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of sound , ( Mach 1.4 ) .
Since the source is moving faster ( with a speed ) than the sound waves it creates , it actually leads the advancing wavefront .
The sound source will pass by a stationary observer ( with a speed ) before the observer actually hears the sound it creates .
As a result , an observer in front of the source will detect
and an observer behind the source .
A sonic boom produced by an aircraft moving at M=2.92 , calculated from the cone angle of 20 degrees .
An observer hears the boom when the shock wave , on the edges of the cone , crosses his or her location .
Mach cone angle
A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object traveling through the air faster than the speed of sound .
Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy , sounding much like an explosion .
The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead is an example of a sonic boom in miniature .
what channel is jay leno on ?
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is an American late-night talk show hosted by Jay Leno that initially aired from May 25 , 1992 to May 29 , 2009 , and resumed production on March 1 , 2010 .
The fourth incarnation of the Tonight Show franchise made its debut on May 25 , 1992 , three days following Johnny Carson 's retirement as host of the program .
The program originates from NBC Studios in Burbank , California , and is broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35 PM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones ( 10:35 PM Central / Mountain time ) .
Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar , Leno only once utilized a guest host , preferring to host the series by himself .
On April 26 , 1999 , the show began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV , becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition .
The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio .
The series , which followed the same basic format as that of his predecessors ( an opening monologue followed by comedy routines , interviews and performances ) , ran until May 29 , 2009 , after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien .
NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot .
The primetime series , titled The Jay Leno Show , debuted on September 14 , 2009 , following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of Tonight .
Neither O'Brien 's version of the program , which premiered June 1 , 2009 , nor The Jay Leno Show generated the ratings that NBC had expected .
The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno 's show to O'Brien 's time slot , and O'Brien 's Tonight Show a half-hour later .
This decision met with opposition from O'Brien , whose stint on The Tonight Show ended January 22 , 2010 , after which he began his own talk show on TBS .
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno then began its second and current incarnation , the sixth of the franchise , on March 1 , 2010 .
how is rfid tag powered
RFID chip next to a grain of rice .
This chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates an external magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when queried by a reader device .
This small type is incorporated in consumer products , and implanted in pets , for identification purposes .
Radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data , for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects .
The tags contain electronically stored information .
Some tags are powered and read at short ranges ( a few meters ) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ) .
Others use a local power source such as a battery , or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field , and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves ( i.e. , electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies ) .
Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters .
Unlike a bar code , the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader , and may be embedded in the tracked object .
RFID tags are used in many industries .
An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line .
Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses .
Livestock and pets may have tags injected , allowing positive identification of the animal .
Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing , possessions , or even implanted within people , the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy concerns .
how does fraud called the psyche mind
Id , ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud 's structural model of the psyche ; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described .
According to this model of the psyche , the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends ; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role ; and the ego is the organized , realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego .
The super-ego can stop you from doing certain things that your id may want you to do .
Even though the model is structural and makes reference to an apparatus , the id , ego and super-ego are functions of the mind rather than parts of the brain and do not correspond one-to-one with actual somatic structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience .
The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud 's thought : the `` structural model '' ( which succeeded his `` economic model '' and `` topographical model '' ) was first discussed in his 1920 essay `` Beyond the Pleasure Principle `` and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his `` The Ego and the Id `` .
Freud 's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term `` unconscious `` and its many conflicting uses .
what does CTA stand for afrotc
Air Force ROTC emblem
The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps ( AFROTC ) is one of the three primary commissioning sources for officers in the United States Air Force , the other two being the United States Air Force Academy ( USAFA ) and Air Force Officer Training School ( OTS ) .
A subordinate command of the Air University within the Air Education and Training Command ( AETC ) , AFROTC is aligned under the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development at Maxwell AFB , Alabama .
The Holm Center , formerly known as the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools ( AFOATS ) , retains direct responsibility for both AFROTC and OTS .
AFROTC is the largest and oldest source of commissioned officers for the U.S. Air Force .
AFROTC 's stated mission is to produce quality leaders for the U.S. Air Force .
AFROTC units are located on 144 college and university campuses with 984 additional institutions of higher learning participating in cross-town agreements that allow their students to attend AFROTC classes at a nearby `` host '' college or university .
According to AFOATS HQ , in 2006 , AFROTC commissioned 2,083 USAF Second Lieutenants , with AFROTC enrollment ranging from 23,605 in 1985 to 10,231 in 1993 , and around 13,000 enrolled today .
AFROTC units at colleges and universities are called `` detachments , '' and are typically headed by an active duty USAF officer in the rank of colonel or lieutenant colonel who functions as both the Detachment Commander for USAF purposes and with the nominal title of Professor of Aerospace Studies ( PAS ) within the institution 's academic community .
Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies .
The PAS is assisted by three to four Assistant Professors of Aerospace Studies ( APAS ) , all active duty USAF officers in the ranks of major or captain .
Three USAF non-commissioned officers and one senior non-commissioned officer will typically provide military administrative support and are often augmented by one to two civilian staff support employees of the academic institution .
Within AFROTC detachments , the students ( referred to as `` cadets '' ) are organized into wings , groups , squadrons , and flights , mirroring the USAF functional wing structure .
The AFROTC detachment 's cadet wing or cadet group is separated into two divisions : the General Military Course ( GMC ) consisting of the first two years of training , and the Professional Officer Course ( POC ) consisting of the last two years of training .
The AFROTC program is also divided into two training functions : the Academic Classroom Program ( Aerospace Studies classes ) and Cadet Activities ( i.e. , Leadership Laboratory , Physical Training , and other training ) .
how is paper measured
Paper density ( also known as basis weight and grammage ) is a term used in the pulp and paper industry and also for fabric industry to denote a measure of mass of the product per unit of area for a type of fabric , paper or paperboard .
The term `` density '' is not used in its traditional sense of mass per unit volume .
`` Paper density '' , rather , is a measure of the area density .
Paper products that let little or no light pass through ( e.g . poster board ) are considered dense or heavy .
Paper products that allow some light to pass through ( e.g . tissue paper ) are considered lightweight .
In the pulp and paper industry , it is common to set a commercial paper machine to produce paper to a target paper density .
Paper density can also be used to distinguish paper from paperboard as the latter usually has a grammage greater than 134 g/m2 .
Two ways of expressing paper density are commonly used:
Expressed in grams per square meter ( g/m2 ) , paper density is also known as grammage .
This is the measure used in most parts of the world .
Expressed in terms of the mass ( expressed as weight ) per number of sheets , it is known as basis weight .
The convention used in the United States and a few other countries using US paper sizes is pounds of a ream of 500 ( or in some cases 1000 ) sheets of a given ( raw , still uncut ) basis size .
Japanese paper is expressed as the weight in kg of 1000 sheets .

what jobs did hans christian anderson have besides writing ?
Hans Christian Andersen ( ; often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen ; April 2 , 1805August 4 , 1875 ) was a Danish author and poet .
Although a prolific writer of plays , travelogues , novels , and poems , Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales , a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote .
Andersen 's popularity is not limited to children ; his stories—called , or `` fantastic tales '' —express themes that transcend age and nationality .
During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty .
Andersen 's fairy tales , which have been translated into more than 125 languages , have become culturally embedded in the West 's collective consciousness , readily accessible to children , but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well .
They have inspired motion pictures , plays , ballets , and animated films .
What culture is it that children do not look adults in the eyes ?
Two figures locking eyes in Caravaggio 's The Fortune Teller
Eye contact occurs when `` two people look at each other 's eyes at the same time . ''
In human beings , eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication and is thought to have a large influence on social behavior .
Coined in the early to mid-1960s , the term has come in the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence and social communication .
The customs and significance of eye contact vary widely between cultures , with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly .
The study of eye contact is sometimes known as oculesics .
how do you get bed bugs
Bed bugs are parasitic insects of the cimicid family that feed exclusively on blood .
The term most commonly refers to members of the genus Cimex of which Cimex lectularius , the common bed bug , is the best known as it prefers to feed on human blood although other Cimex species are specialized to other animals , e.g. , bat bugs , C. pipistrelli ( Europe ) , C. pilosellus ( western US ) , and C. adjunctus ( entire eastern US ) .
The name of the `` bed bug '' is derived from the preferred habitat of Cimex lectularius : warm houses and especially nearby or inside of beds and bedding or other sleep areas .
Bed bugs are mainly active at night , but are not exclusively nocturnal .
They usually feed on their hosts without being noticed .
A number of adverse health effects may result from bed bug bites , including skin rashes , psychological effects , and allergic symptoms .
Diagnosis involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms .
Bed bugs have been known as human parasites for thousands of years .
At a point in the early 1940s , they were mostly eradicated in the developed world , but have increased in prevalence since 1995 .
Because infestation of human habitats has been on the increase , bed bug bites and related conditions have been on the rise as well .
what does it mean when isaiah of the bible in chapter 55 : verses 8,9 mean
The Book of Isaiah ( ) is the first of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible , preceding Ezekiel , Jeremiah and the Book of the Twelve .
( The order of the subsequent books differs somewhat in the Christian Old Testament ) .
The first 39 chapters prophesy doom for a sinful Judah and for all the nations of the world that oppose God , while the last 27 prophesy the restoration of the nation of Israel and a new creation in God 's glorious future kingdom ; this section includes the Songs of the Suffering Servant , four separate passages referring to the nation of Israel , interpreted by Christians as prefiguring the coming of Jesus Christ .
Tradition ascribes authorship of the book to Isaiah son of Amoz , but now scholars widely agree that the book is the work of three different authors - few scholars deny this view , and those that do , do so for theological reasons .
The first , termed Proto-Isaiah ( chapters 1–39 ) , contains the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet with 7th-century BCE expansions ; the second , Deutero-Isaiah ( chapters 40–55 ) , is the work of a 6th-century BCE author writing near the end of the Babylonian captivity ; and the third , the poetic Trito-Isaiah ( chapters 56–66 ) , was composed in Jerusalem shortly after the return from exile , probably by multiple authors .

how much can female ejaculate
Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid by human females from the paraurethral ducts through and around the female urethra during or before an orgasm .
It is also known colloquially as gushing or squirting , although these are considered to be different phenomena in some research publications .
The exact source and nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals , which is also related to doubts over the existence of the G-Spot .
how long have kanab ambersnail been endangered ?
The Kanab ambersnail , scientific name Oxyloma haydeni kanabensis or Oxyloma kanabense , is a critically endangered subspecies or species of small , air-breathing land snail , a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Succineidae , the amber snails .
The common name of the amber snails is based on the shell , which is translucent and when empty usually resembles amber in color .
This species is endemic to the United States , specifically the state of Arizona and Utah , where it was first collected in the early 20th century .
It has been listed as endangered on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species since 8 August 1991 .
This snail lives in wetlands , springs , and seeps , and only two of its natural habitats are known to exist : Three Lakes , a meadow near Kanab , Utah , and Vasey 's Paradise , a spring along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park .
In its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous , feeding mainly on bacteria , plants and fungi , and reproduces during the summer .
Now considered a Critically Endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to a series of factors ( including influence ) , the Kanab ambersnail has been reintroduced to three springs above the historic high water level along the Colorado River .
how many spanish speaking people are there in the us
The Spanish language is the second most used language in the United States .
There are more Spanish speakers in the United States than there are speakers of Chinese , French , German , Italian , Hawaiian , and the Native American languages combined .
According to the 2010 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau , Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by almost 37 million people aged five or older , a figure more than double that of 1990 .
There are 45 million Hispanophones who speak Spanish as a first or second language , as well as six million Spanish language students , composing the largest national Spanish-speaking community outside of Mexico and making Spanish the Romance language and the Indo-European language with largest number of native speakers in the world .
Roughly half of all U.S. Spanish speakers also speak English `` very well , '' based on the self-assessment Census question respondents .
The language came to the country since the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of Spanish colonists in areas that would later become the states of Florida , Texas , Colorado , New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , Utah , and California and of the Spanish explorers - who explored areas of 42 states- .
Also west of Louisiana Territory was Spanish between 1763 - 1800 ( year of the French recovery of territory ) , after the French and Indian War .
After of the incorporation of these states to the U.S. in first half of 19th century , the Spanish language was later reinforced by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898 and by later waves of the Hispanic emigration , basically from Hispanic America , to the United States beginning in the second half of 19th century until today .

what animal is Mint in tokyo mew mew
alt=Five smiling young girls in various poses wearing white smocks over thigh-length dresses of similar color to their hair .
The Tokyo Mew Mew manga and anime series features a cast of characters designed by Mia Ikumi .
The series takes place in Tokyo , Japan , where five adolescent girls , called Mew Mews , are infused with the DNA of endangered species to combat aliens attempting to take over the Earth .
The manga series is followed by a short sequel series , Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode , which introduces a new Mew Mew and a new threat .
The Mew Mews are led by the main character , Ichigo Momomiya , whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews : Mint Aizawa , Lettuce Midorikawa , Pudding Fong , and Zakuro Fujiwara .
As the series progresses , Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to becoming his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him .
The series antagonists include three aliens , Kish , Pie , and Tart , and their leader , Deep Blue .
Originally from Earth , the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes .
They have returned to kill the humans , who they feel are destroying their planet , and reclaim the planet .
In a la Mode , middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and , in the absence of Ichigo , the temporary leader of the Mew Mews .
A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists , the Saint Rose Crusaders , a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia .
Led by Duke , they make several attempts to kill Berry , eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews .
Ikumi 's initial vision for Tokyo Mew Mew was a story called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that featured a cat-girl battling alien invaders .
After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superheroes , the character designs were redone to have a lighter , more colorful feel .
The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story , as well as for their cute appearances .
The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances , but criticized as being repeats of the original series .
The character Duke was also criticized for having a design reminiscent of the white supremacy group , the Ku Klux Klan .
how does sedimentary rock form
Middle Triassic marginal marine sequence of siltstones ( below ) and limestones ( above ) , Virgin Formation , southwestern Utah , USA
Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the Earth 's surface and within bodies of water .
Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles ( detritus ) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution .
Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment .
Before being deposited , sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area , and then transported to the place of deposition by water , wind , ice , mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation .
The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth 's crust is extensive , but the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8 % of the total volume of the crust .
Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks .
Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata , forming a structure called bedding .
The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering , for example in the construction of roads , houses , tunnels , canals or other constructions .
Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources like coal , fossil fuels , drinking water or ores .
The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for scientific knowledge about the Earth 's history , including palaeogeography , paleoclimatology and the history of life .
The scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology .
Sedimentology is both part of geology and physical geography and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the Earth sciences , such as pedology , geomorphology , geochemistry or structural geology .

what did st.patrick do
Saint Patrick ( ; ; Modern ; ; c. 387 – 17 March c. 460 or c. 492 ) was a Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland .
Known as the `` Apostle of Ireland '' , he is the primary patron saint of the island along with Saints Brigid and Columba .
Two authentic letters from him survive , from which come the only generally accepted details of his life .
When he was about 16 , he was captured from his home and taken as a slave to Ireland , where he lived for six years before escaping and returning to his family .
After becoming a cleric , he returned to northern and western Ireland as an ordained bishop , but little is known about the places where he worked .
By the seventh century , he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland .
Most available details of his life are from subsequent hagiographies , and these are now not accepted without detailed criticism .
The Annals of Ulster state that he arrived in Ireland in 432 , ministered in Ulster around 443 , and died in 457 or 461 .
The text , however , distinguishes between `` Old Patrick '' ( thought to mean Palladius ) and `` Patrick , archapostle of the Scots , '' who died in 492 .
The actual dates of Patrick 's life can not be fixed with certainty but , on a widespread interpretation , he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the second half of the 5th century .
He is generally credited with being the first bishop of Armagh , Primate of All Ireland .
Saint Patrick 's Day is observed on March 17 , the date of his death .
It is celebrated both inside and outside Ireland , as both a religious and , especially outside Ireland , secular holiday .
In the dioceses of Ireland , it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation ; outside Ireland , it can be a celebration of Ireland itself .
how do you know if something is the golden ratio
Line segments in the golden ratio
A golden rectangle with longer side a and shorter side b , when placed adjacent to a square with sides of length a , will produce a similar golden rectangle with longer side a + b and shorter side a .
This illustrates the relationship .
In mathematics and the arts , two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one .
The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship .
Expressed algebraically:
where the Greek letter phi ( ) represents the golden ratio .
Its value is:
The golden ratio is also called the golden section ( Latin : sectio aurea ) or golden mean .
Other names include extreme and mean ratio , medial section , divine proportion , divine section ( Latin : sectio divina ) , golden proportion , golden cut , and golden number .
Many 20th century artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle , in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing ( see Applications and observations below ) .
Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio , including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle , which can be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio .
The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets , in some cases based on dubious fits to data .

what country in the middle east did france take control of after ww1
World War I ( WWI ) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918 .
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939 , and the First World War or World War I thereafter .
It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) .
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers .
Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
Within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .
While the Russians mobilised , the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France , providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany .
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans .
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai .
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916 .
In Russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers .
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front , the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches .
Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 .
The war ended in victory for the Allies .
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
By the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .

Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey , United States .
It is the county seat , located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia .
As of the 2010 United States Census the city had a total population of 77,344 , representing a decline of 2,560 ( 3.2 % ) from the 79,904 residents enumerated during the 2000 Census , which had in turn declined by 7,588 ( 8.7 % ) from the 87,492 counted in the 1990 Census .
Camden ranked as the 12th-most populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 10th in 2000 .
Camden was originally incorporated as a city on February 13 , 1828 , from portions of the now-defunct Newton Township , while the area was still part of Gloucester County .
On March 13 , 1844 , Camden became part of the newly formed Camden County .
Although once a thriving center for manufacturing and industry , Camden is perhaps best known for its struggles with urban dysfunction .
Three Camden mayors have been jailed for corruption , the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000 .
Since 2005 the school system and police department have been operated by the state of New Jersey ; the takeover expired in 2012 .
In 2008 , Camden had the highest crime rate in the U.S. with 2,333 violent crimes per 100,000 people while the national average was 455 per 100,000 .
Camden public schools spent $ 23,770 per student ( $ 19,118 on a budgetary per-pupil basis ) in the 2009–10 school year and two-thirds of the students graduate .
Two out of every five residents are below the national poverty line .
how rare are cardiac issues with amitriptyline
Amitriptyline ( Tryptomer , Elavil , Tryptizol , Laroxyl , Saroten , Sarotex , Lentizol , Endep ) is a tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) .
It is the most widely used TCA and has at least equal efficacy against depression as the newer class of SSRIs according to a study from early 2001 .
As well as reducing depressive symptoms , these types of tricyclics also ease migraines , tension headaches , anxiety attacks and some schizophrenic symptoms .
It is also known to reduce aggression and violent behavior .
How is a computer used ?
A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations .
Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed , the computer can solve more than one kind of problem .
Conventionally , a computer consists of at least one processing element , typically a central processing unit ( CPU ) and some form of memory .
The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations , and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information .
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source , and the result of operations saved and retrieved .
The first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States .
Originally they were the size of a large room , consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers ( PCs ) .
In this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications .
Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines , and occupy a fraction of the space .
Simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices , and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries .
Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as “computers.”
However , the embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous .
what does barefoot and pregnant mean
`` Barefoot and pregnant '' is a phrase most commonly associated with the controversial idea that women should not work outside the home and should have many children during their reproductive years .
It has several other meanings as well .
It is a figure of speech .
The phrase `` barefoot and pregnant '' was probably first used sometime before 1950 .
An article from 1949 states , `` By early 1949 , TWA was—in the words of its new president , Ralph S. Damon—both 'barefoot and pregnant . ' ''
Its usage may date as early as the 1910s .
An article published in 1958 states the phrase was first used by a `` Dr. Hertzler '' 40 years earlier .
`` Some forty years ago , Dr. Hertzler advanced a hypothesis which young women of today seem bent on proving correct. '
The only way to keep a woman happy , ' he said , 'is to keep her barefoot and pregnant . ' ''

how many innings in overtime in baseball
An inning , or innings , is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring .
In cricket , the term innings is both singular and plural and is always spelled and pronounced with the terminal `` s '' .
In baseball and softball , the singular form is inning and only the plural takes an `` s '' .
In many other sports , the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item .
In baseball and cricket , however , one team , said to be `` batting '' , attempts to score `` runs '' —see run ( baseball ) and run ( cricket ) —while the other team , said to be `` fielding '' , attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out .
The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out , making a clock unnecessary .
In cricket , the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player ( Smith had a poor innings , scoring only 12 ) .
By extension , this term can be used in British English for almost any activity which takes a period of time ( The Liberal government had a good innings , but finally lost office in 1972 , or You 've had a fair innings , now it 's my turn , meaning `` you have spoken for long enough , now let me speak '' ) .
It is also used in reference to someone who has died at a reasonably old age or lived a rich and rewarding life ( Ah , well .
John was 89 .
At least he had a good innings ) .
The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735 .
As cricket was a mature , highly organized sport in the 1600s in England , the term 's origin could well precede this first recorded usage .
The word inning meaning 'a gathering in ' is first recorded in 1522 , and could be related .
what causes a deficiency in adenosine deaminase
Adenosine deaminase deficiency , also called ADA deficiency or ADA-SCID , is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency .
It occurs in fewer than one in 100,000 live births worldwide .
It accounts for about 15 % of all cases of severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) .
It is very rare , you have a 3 % chance of getting this gene .
ADA deficiency may be present in infancy , childhood , adolescense , or adulthood .
Age of onset and severity is related to some 29 known genotypes associated with the disorder .
how poverty affects intelligence
An example of urban poverty in this slum in Jakarta , Indonesia
Poverty is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money .
Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs , which commonly includes food , water , sanitation , clothing , shelter , health care and education .
Relative poverty is defined contextually as economic inequality in the location or society in which people live .
For much of history , poverty was considered largely unavoidable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living .
After the industrial revolution , mass production in factories made wealth increasingly more inexpensive and accessible .
Of more importance is the modernization of agriculture , such as fertilizers , in order to provide enough yield to feed the population .
The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption , tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals .
Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare , economic freedoms , and providing financial services .
Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank .
The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008 .
Of these , about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China .
In USA 1 in 5 children lives in poverty .
In terms of percentage of regional populations , sub-Saharan Africa at 47 % had the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008 .
Between 1990 and 2010 , about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level .
Still , extreme poverty is a global challenge ; it is observed in all parts of the world , including the developed economies .
how long before symptoms of deadly mushrooms
Mushroom poisoning ( also known as mycetism ) refers to harmful effects from ingestion of toxic substances present in a mushroom .
These symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death .
The toxins present are secondary metabolites produced in specific biochemical pathways in the fungal cells .
Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species .
The most common reason for this misidentification is close resemblance in terms of colour and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species .
Even very experienced wild mushroom gatherers are upon rare occasion poisoned by eating toxic species , despite being well aware of the risks , through carelessness .
To prevent mushroom poisoning , mushroom gatherers need to be very familiar with the mushrooms they intend to collect as well as with any similar-looking toxic species .
In addition , edibility of mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking .
Collectors also need to be well aware that edibility or toxicity of some species varies with geographic location .
how is human height measured
Human height is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body , standing erect .
When populations share genetic background and environmental factors , average height is frequently characteristic within the group .
Exceptional height variation ( around 20 % deviation from average ) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism , which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities .
In regions of extreme poverty or prolonged warfare , environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may account for delayed growth and/or ( in severe cases ) marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions .
how did neil armstrong affect the united states
Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans , Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , on the Moon on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:18 UTC .
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC .
Armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft , Aldrin slightly less ; and together they collected of lunar material for return to Earth .
A third member of the mission , Michael Collins , piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth .
Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island , Florida on July 16 , Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program .
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts which was the only part which landed back on Earth ; a Service Module which supported the Command Module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen and water ; and a Lunar Module for landing on the Moon .
After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's upper stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and travelled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit .
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the Sea of Tranquility .
They stayed a total of about 21 and a half hours on the lunar surface .
After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module , they returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 .
Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience , Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . ''
Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the United States Congress , `` before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . ''
what countries have won the world cup
The FIFA World Cup , often simply the World Cup , is an international association football competition contested by the senior men 's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body .
The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930 , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War .
The current champions are Spain , who won the 2010 tournament .
The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation ( s ) over a period of about a month ; this phase is often called the World Cup Finals .
A qualification phase , which currently takes place over the preceding three years , is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation ( s ) .
The 19 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different national teams .
Brazil have won five times , and they are the only team to have played in every tournament .
The other World Cup winners are Italy , with four titles ; Germany , with three titles ; Argentina and inaugural winners Uruguay , with two titles each ; and England , France , and Spain , with one title each .
The World Cup is the world 's most widely viewed sporting event ; an estimated 715.1 million people watched the final match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany .
The next three World Cups will be hosted by Brazil in 2014 , Russia in 2018 , and Qatar in 2022 .
how many native Americans did the United States kill or deport ?
Genocide is a term coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin to describe the deliberate and systematic destruction , in whole or in part , of an ethnic , racial , religious , or national group .
It is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( CPPCG ) of 1948 as `` any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : killing members of the group ; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life , calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; [ and ] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . ''
Skulls of victims of the Rwandan Genocide
The preamble to the CPPCG not only states that `` genocide is a crime under international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world '' , but also that `` at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity '' .
Determining what historical events constitute a genocide and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter .
In nearly every case where accusations of genocide have circulated , partisans of various sides have fiercely disputed the interpretation and details of the event , often to the point of promoting wildly different versions of the facts .
An accusation of genocide is certainly not taken lightly and will almost always be controversial .
The following list of genocides and alleged genocides should be understood in this context and can not be regarded as the final word on these subjects .
what does a timing belt do
A timing belt is a non-slipping mechanical drive belt and the term may refer to either:
Toothed belt , a flexible belt with teeth moulded onto its inner surface
Timing belt ( camshaft ) , a toothed belt used to drive the camshaft ( s ) within an internal combustion engine
how latin america has changed us culture
The culture of the United States is primarily a Western culture , but is also influenced by Native American , African , Asian , Polynesian , and Latin American cultures .
American culture started its formation over 10,000 years ago with the migration of Paleo-Indians from Asia into the region that is today the continental United States .
It has its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as dialect , music , arts , social habits , cuisine , and folklore .
The United States of America is an ethnically and racially diverse country as a result of large-scale immigration from many different countries throughout its history .
Its chief early European influences came from English , Scottish , Welsh and Irish settlers of colonial America during British rule .
British culture , due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language , legal system and other cultural inheritances , had a formative influence .
Other important influences came from other parts of western Europe , especially Germany , France , and Italy .
Original elements also play a strong role , such as the invention of Jeffersonian democracy .
Thomas Jefferson 's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America 's domestic originality was degenerate .
Prevalent ideas and ideals that evolved domestically , such as national holidays , uniquely American sports , military tradition , and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole .
American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements , scientific and religious competitiveness , political structures , risk taking and free expression , materialist and moral elements .
Despite certain consistent ideological principles ( e.g . individualism , egalitarianism , and faith in freedom and democracy ) , American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity .
The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a mythic identity ; others see it as American exceptionalism .
It also includes elements that evolved from Indigenous Americans , and other ethnic cultures—most prominently the culture of African Americans , cultures from Latin America , and Asian American cultures .
Many American cultural elements , especially from popular culture , have spread across the globe through modern mass media .
The United States has often been thought of as a melting pot , but beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s , it trends towards cultural diversity , pluralism and the image of a salad bowl instead .
Due to the extent of American culture , there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United States .
The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on social class , political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background , occupation and ethnic group membership .
what does point in samoan
Samoan ( Gagana fa'a Sāmoa or Gagana Sāmoa — IPA : ) is the language of the Samoan Islands , comprising the independent country of Samoa and the United States territory of American Samoa .
It is an official language—alongside English —in both jurisdictions .
Samoan , a Polynesian language , is the first language for most of the Samoa Islands ' population of about 246,000 .
With many Samoan people living in other countries , the total number of speakers worldwide is estimated at 370,000 .
The language is notable for the phonological differences between formal and informal speech as well as a ceremonial form used in Samoan oratory .
how is 5 hour glucose tolerance test performed
A glucose tolerance test is a medical test in which glucose is given and blood samples taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood .
The test is usually used to test for diabetes , insulin resistance , and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia and acromegaly , or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism .
In the most commonly performed version of the test , an oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , a standard dose of glucose is ingested by mouth and blood levels are checked two hours later .
Many variations of the GTT have been devised over the years for various purposes , with different standard doses of glucose , different routes of administration , different intervals and durations of sampling , and various substances measured in addition to blood glucose .
what about me moving pictures
`` What About Me '' is a song written by Garry Frost and Frances Swan , first recorded by Australian rock band Moving Pictures from their album Days of Innocence .
It was the band 's first number-one single in Australia spending six consecutive weeks on the top ; there , it was the second-highest selling single of 1982 .
The success of the song led them to America where it became a hit , reaching # 29 on the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 chart .
The song stayed in the U.S. charts for such a long time that it managed to make Billboards top 100 Pop Singles of 1983 , at # 88 , a rare feat for a single with such a low peak position .
The song made an unusual comeback in 1989 , peaking at # 46 .
how many eggs per chicken is expected
On the left a chicken egg , the egg most commonly eaten by humans , and on the right two quail eggs
Eggs are laid by females of many different species , including birds , reptiles , amphibians , and fish , and have been eaten by mankind for thousands of years .
Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell , albumen ( egg white ) , and vitellus ( egg yolk ) , contained within various thin membranes .
Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken , duck , quail , roe , and caviar , but the egg most often consumed by humans is the chicken egg , by a wide margin .
Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline , and are widely used in cookery .
Due to their protein content , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) categorizes eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid .
Despite the nutritional value of eggs , there are some potential health issues arising from egg quality , storage , and individual allergies .
Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are widely kept throughout the world , and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry .
In 2009 , an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens .
There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation , as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production , with the European Union 's ban on battery farming of chickens .

what countries legalize marijuana
The legality of cannabis varies from country to country .
Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s .
However , many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis , particularly in North America , South America and Europe .
Furthermore , possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law , which governs persons in all states .
The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries , including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel .
While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis , enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law ; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime , also contrary to federal statute .
Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but , apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana , most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe .
Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation , use , possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use .
A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis , making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment .
Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users , with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes .
There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada .
Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs .
However , simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries , particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution .
how is the ejection fraction measured
In cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction ( EF ) represents the volumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle ( heart ) with each heart beat or cardiac cycle .
It can be applied to either the right ventricle which ejects via the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary circulation or the left ventricle which ejects via the aortic valve into the systemic circulation .
Imaging of the physiology of the mammalian heart is the art that allows meaningful mathematical expression defining EF .
Noninvasive cardiac imaging has become a worldwide utility enabling study of cardiac performance reproducibly and inexpensively .
Simplified , Ejection fraction is a mathematical product allowed by cardiac imaging .
As a mathematical term , Ejection Fraction is an extension of the work of Adolph Fick in cardiac output .
Dedicated technology such as Echocardiography , Computed Tomography , Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MUGA scanning have definitively allowed clinically relevant mathematics regarding Ischemia , Congenital Heart Disease and Heart Failure .
how is traffic from palmdale to santa clarita ?
State Route 14 ( SR 14 ) is a north–south state highway in the U.S. state of California , largely in the Mojave Desert .
The southern portion of the highway is signed as the Antelope Valley Freeway .
The route connects Interstate 5 , or Golden State Freeway , near Santa Clarita and with U.S. Route 395 near Inyokern .
Legislatively , the route extends south of I-5 to State Route 1 in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles , however the portion south of the junction with I-5 has not been constructed .
The southern part of the constructed route is a busy commuter freeway serving and connecting the communities of Santa Clarita , Palmdale and Lancaster with the rest of the Greater Los Angeles area .
The northern portion , from Vincent ( south of Palmdale ) to Route 395 , is legislatively named the Aerospace Highway , as the highway serves Edwards Air Force Base , once one of the primary landing strips for NASA 's Space Shuttle .
This section is rural , following the line between the hot Mojave desert and the forming Sierra Nevada mountain range .
Most of Route 14 is loosely paralleled by a main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad , used for the Antelope Valley Line of the Metrolink commuter rail system as well as a connection between Los Angeles and the California Central Valley via Tehachapi Pass .
Linked with US 395 , this road connects Los Angeles with such places as Mammoth Mountain , Mono Lake , Yosemite National Park and Reno , Nevada .
Route 14 was part of U.S. Route 6 prior to truncation in 1964 , when U.S. 6 was a coast-to-coast route from Long Beach to Provincetown , Massachusetts .
The non-freeway segment of SR 14 from Silver Queen Road north of Rosamond to Mojave is known as Sierra Highway , as is the old routing between Interstate 5 and Silver Queen Road where SR 14 has been moved to a newer freeway alignment .
Portions of Route 14 remain signed with names associated with US 6 , including Midland Trail , Theodore Roosevelt Highway and Grand Army of the Republic Highway .
This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System .
how many blind people are there in the us
Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors .
Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness .
Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP , an abbreviation for `` no light perception . ''
Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with vision .
Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source .
To determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities , various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as legal blindness .
In North America and most of Europe , legal blindness is defined as visual acuity ( vision ) of 20/200 ( 6/60 ) or less in the better eye with best correction possible .
This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand from an object to see it—with corrective lenses —with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from .
In many areas , people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees ( the norm being 180 degrees ) are also classified as being legally blind .
Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind , by any measure , have no vision .
The rest have some vision , from light perception alone to relatively good acuity .
Low vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200 .
By the 10th Revision of the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases , Injuries and Causes of Death , low vision is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/60 ( 6/18 ) , but equal to or better than 20/200 ( 6/60 ) , or corresponding visual field loss to less than 20 degrees , in the better eye with best possible correction .
Blindness is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/400 ( 6/120 ) , or corresponding visual field loss to less than 10 degrees , in the better eye with best possible correction .
Blind people with undamaged eyes may still register light non-visually for the purpose of circadian entrainment to the 24-hour light/dark cycle .
Light signals for this purpose travel through the retinohypothalamic tract and are not affected by optic nerve damage beyond where the retinohypothalamic tract exits .

what do mucous membranes secrete
The mucous membranes ( or mucosae or mucosas ; singular mucosa ) are linings of mostly endodermal origin , covered in epithelium , which are involved in absorption and secretion .
They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs .
They are at several places contiguous with skin : at the nostrils , the lips of the mouth , the eyelids , the ears , the genital area , and the anus .
The sticky , thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus .
The term mucous membrane refers to where they are found in the body and not every mucous membrane secretes mucus .
The glans clitoridis , glans penis ( head of the penis ) , along with the inside of the foreskin and the clitoral hood , are mucous membranes .
The urethra is also a mucous membrane .
The secreted mucus traps the pathogens in the body , preventing any further activities of diseases .

how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in
Cake is a form of bread or bread-like food .
In its modern forms , it is typically a sweet baked dessert .
In its oldest forms , cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes , and normally had a disk shape .
Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread , cake , or pastry can be difficult .
Modern cake , especially layer cakes , normally contain a combination of flour , sugar , eggs , and butter or oil , with some varieties also requiring liquid ( typically milk or water ) and leavening agents ( such as yeast or baking powder ) .
Flavorful ingredients like fruit purées , nuts , dried or candied fruit , or extracts are often added , and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients are possible .
Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces ( like pastry cream ) , iced with buttercream or other icings , and decorated with marzipan , piped borders or candied fruit .
Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions , particularly weddings , anniversaries , and birthdays .
There are countless cake recipes ; some are bread-like , some rich and elaborate , and many are centuries old .
Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure ; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making ( particularly the whisking of egg foams ) , baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake .

how is public policy created
Public policy is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs .
In general , the foundation is the pertinent national and substantial constitutional law and implementing legislation such as the US Federal code .
Further substrates include both judicial interpretations and regulations which are generally authorized by legislation .
Other scholars define it as a system of `` courses of action , regulatory measures , laws , and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives . ''
Public policy is commonly embodied `` in constitutions , legislative acts , and judicial decisions . ''
In the United States , this concept refers not only to the result of policies , but more broadly to the decision-making and analysis of governmental decisions .
As an academic discipline , public policy is studied by professors and students at public policy schools of major universities throughout the country .
The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners , researchers , scholars , and students is the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management .
how does an earthworm eat & digests food .
Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream , for instance .
Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones .
When food enters the mouth , digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva .
Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food .
After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus .
It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis .
Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion .
Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin .
As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals .
At the same time protein digestion is occurring , mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall .
This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes .
After some time ( typically an hour or two in humans , 4–6 hours in dogs , somewhat shorter duration in house cats ) , the resulting thick liquid is called chyme .
When the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas , and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues .
When the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood .
95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine .
Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon ( large intestine ) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9 .
Some vitamins , such as biotin and vitamin K ( K2MK7 ) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon .
Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation .
how many wives did henry the 8th have
Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was king of England from 21 April 1509 until his death .
He was lord , and later king , of Ireland , as well as continuing the nominal claim by the English monarchs to the Kingdom of France .
Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .
Besides his six marriages , Henry VIII is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church .
Henry 's struggles with Rome led to the separation of the Church of England from papal authority , the Dissolution of the Monasteries , and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England .
Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings , even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church .
Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 .
In 1513 , the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor , Maximillian I , and invaded France in 1513 with a large , well-equipped army , but achieved little at a considerable financial cost .
Maximillian , for his part , used the English invasion to his own ends , and this prejudiced England 's ability to defeat the French .
This foray would prove the start of an obsession for Henry , who invaded again in 1544 .
This time , Henry 's forces captured the important city of Boulogne , but again the Holy Roman Emperor , Charles V , supported Henry only as long as he needed to and England , strained by the enormous cost of the war , ransomed the city back for peace .
His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' .
Besides ruling with absolute power , he also engaged himself as an author and composer .
His desire to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and the English Reformation .
Henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 .
He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king .

Nicknames for the flag include the `` Stars and Stripes '' , `` Old Glory `` , and `` The Star-Spangled Banner . ''
What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v. Sandford ?
Dred Scott v. Sandford , , also known as the Dred Scott Decision , was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It made two main rulings .
The first ruling was that African-Americans were not citizens , and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court .
The second ruling was that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the creation of the United States .
Given the first ruling , most scholars and many contemporary political figures ( including the leadership of the then-new Republican Party ) considered that the second ruling was not binding precedent , but mere dictum .
The rationale of the Supreme Court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of African descent ( both slave and free ) were not protected by the Constitution and were not U.S. citizens .
Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent .
Nonetheless , the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court .
The opinion of the court , written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney , stirred debate .
The decision was 7–2 , and every Justice besides Taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissent .
For the first time since Marbury v. Madison , the Court held an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional .
Dred Scott , an African-American slave , had asked a United States Circuit Court to award him his freedom because he and his master had resided in a state ( Illinois ) and a territory ( Wisconsin Territory ) where slavery had been banned .
Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the court , held that Scott , as a person of African ancestry , was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal court .
This holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time , particularly Free states , where free blacks did in fact enjoy the rights of citizens , such as the right to vote and hold public office .
In what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum , the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because slaves are personal property and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law .
In reaching this decision , Taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the United States , but it had the opposite effect .
The decision was fiercely debated across the country , as perhaps best exemplified by the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858 .
Abraham Lincoln , the second-ever Republican nominee for President , was able to win the presidential election in 1860 ; the stopping of the further expansion of slavery was a key Republican party plank .
The decision played an important role in the timing of state secession and the Civil War , although it is extreme to say the decision `` caused '' the war .
The decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape : it is credited with launching Abraham Lincoln’s national political career and ultimately allowing for his election .
Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case , the Court stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , which begins by stating , `` All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . ''
To which the Court noted:
The first observation we have to make on this clause is , that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion .
It declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State , and it overturns the Dred Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States .

how many gold medals usa won for basketball
The USA Basketball Men 's Senior National Team , commonly known as the United States men 's national basketball team , represents the United States of America in international men 's basketball .
The USA is the most successful team in international competition , winning medals in all seventeen Olympic tournaments it has entered , coming away with fourteen golds .
Two of its gold medal-winning squads were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as teams in August 2010—the 1960 team , which featured six Hall of Famers ( 4 players , 2 coaches ) , and the 1992 `` Dream Team '' , featuring 14 Hall of Famers ( 11 players , 3 coaches ) .
The United States is currently ranked first in the FIBA World Rankings .
Traditionally composed of amateur players , a 1989 rule change by FIBA allowed USA Basketball to field teams with professional players .
The first such team , known as the `` Dream Team '' , won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain , playing in the final against Croatia .
With the introduction of professionals , the team was able to spark a second run of dominance after capturing only a bronze medal in 1988 .
A team of professional players competed at the 1994 FIBA World Championship , finishing first .
In 1996 , 2000 , 2008 , and 2012 the USA again captured gold medals .
Facing increased competition , the USA failed to win a medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship , finishing sixth .
The 2004 Summer Olympic team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal , a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country 's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined .
Determined to put an end to these failures , USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better , more cohesive teams .
The USA won its first seven games at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan before losing against Greece in the semi-finals , ending the competition with the bronze medal .
The USA won gold two years later , though , at the 2008 Summer Olympics with a dominant performance .
This success was followed up at the 2010 FIBA World Championship , where despite fielding a roster featuring no players from the 2008 Olympic team , the USA did not lose a single game en route to defeating host Turkey for the gold medal .
The USA continued this streak of dominance by going undefeated and capturing gold once more at the 2012 Summer Olympics .

The Witch 's Finger in the Carlsbad Caverns
A stalagmite ( or ; from the Greek σταλαγμίτης - stalagmitês , from σταλαγμίας - stalagmias , `` dropping , trickling '' ) is a type of speleothem that rises from the floor of a limestone cave due to the dripping of mineralized solutions and the deposition of calcium carbonate .
This stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the underground cavern .
The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite .
If these formations grow together , the result is known as a column .
The Hall of Giants in the Carlsbad Caverns
Stalagmites should normally not be touched , since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the old surface ; skin oils can alter the surface where the mineral water will cling , thus affecting the growth of the formation .
Oils and dirt from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently .
Similar structures can also form in lava tubes , associated with some types of lavacicles , although the mechanism of formation is very different .
Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors , although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment .
The largest stalagmite in the world is high and is located in the cave of Cueva Martin Infierno , Cuba .
In the Zagros Mountains of south Iran , approximately from the ancient city of Bishapur , in the Shapur cave on the fourth of five terraces stands the 3rd century CE statue of Shapur I , second ruler of the Sassanid Empire .
The statue , carved from one stalagmite , is nearly high .

how many millions of years have great white sharks been around ?
The great white shark , Carcharodon carcharias , also known as the great white , white pointer , white shark , or white death , is a species of large lamniform shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans .
The great white shark is mainly known for its size , with the largest individuals known to have approached or exceeded in length , and in weight .
This shark reaches its maturity around 15 years of age and can have a life span of over 30 years .
The great white shark is arguably the world 's largest known extant macropredatory fish , and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals .
It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals , including fish and seabirds .
It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon , and is ranked first in having the most attacks on humans .
The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species , while it is included in Appendix II of CITES .
The bestselling novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent blockbuster film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a `` ferocious man eater `` .
In reality , humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark .

Both the President and Secretary of Defense are advised by a seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff , which includes the head of each of the Defense Department 's service branches as well as the chief of the National Guard Bureau .
Leadership is provided by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions , under the Unified Combatant Commands , under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the exception of the Coast Guard .
The Coast Guard falls under the administration of the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security .
The Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war .
All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States ; the others are the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps .
From the time of its inception , the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States .
A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War .
Even so , the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established .
The National Security Act of 1947 , adopted following World War II and during the Cold War 's onset , created the modern U.S. military framework ; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment ( renamed the Department of Defense in 1949 ) , headed by the Secretary of Defense ; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council .
The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel .
It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers ; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace , it has not been used since 1972 .
As of 2013 , the U.S. spends about $ 554.2 billion annually to fund its military forces , and appropriates approximately $ 88.5 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations .
Put together , the U.S. constitutes roughly 43 percent of the world 's military expenditures .
The U.S. Armed Forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment , along with widespread placement of forces around the world , giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection .
what does freedom of speech cover
Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one 's opinions and ideas using one 's body and property to anyone who is willing to receive them .
The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously , but includes any act of seeking , receiving and imparting information or ideas , regardless of the medium used .
In practice , the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations , as with libel , slander , obscenity , sedition ( including , for example inciting ethnic hatred ) , copyright violation , revelation of information that is classified or otherwise .
The right to freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) .
Article 19 of the ICCPR states that `` [ e ] veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference '' and `` everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression ; this right shall include freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds , regardless of frontiers , either orally , in writing or in print , in the form of art , or through any other media of his choice '' .
Article 19 goes on to say that the exercise of these rights carries `` special duties and responsibilities `` and may `` therefore be subject to certain restrictions '' when necessary `` [ f ] or respect of the rights or reputation of others '' or `` [ f ] or the protection of national security or of public order ( order public ) , or of public health or morals '' .
Freedom of speech may be legally curtailed in some religious legal systems and in secular jurisdictions where it is found to cause religious offense , such as the British Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 .

what branch of army was dwight d eisenhower in
Dwight David `` Ike '' Eisenhower ( pronounced , ; October 14 , 1890 – March 28 , 1969 ) was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961 .
He had previously been a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe ; he had responsibility for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942–43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944–45 from the Western Front .
In 1951 , he became the first supreme commander of NATO .
Eisenhower was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry and was reared in a large family in Kansas by parents with a robust work ethic and religious background .
As one of six sons , he was conditioned by a competitive atmosphere which instilled self-reliance .
He attended and graduated from West Point and later married and had two sons .
After World War II , Eisenhower served as Army Chief of Staff under President Harry S. Truman , then assumed the post of President at Columbia University .
Eisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a Republican to counter the non-interventionism of Senator Robert A. Taft and to crusade against `` Communism , Korea and corruption '' .
He won by a landslide , defeating Democrat Adlai Stevenson and ending two decades of the New Deal Coalition .
In the first year of his presidency , Eisenhower deposed the leader of Iran in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état and used nuclear threats to conclude the Korean War with China .
His New Look policy of nuclear deterrence gave priority to inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing the funding for conventional military forces ; the goal was to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits .
In 1954 , Eisenhower first articulated the domino theory in his description of the threat presented by the spread of communism .
The Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for the Formosa Resolution , which enabled him to prevent Chinese communist aggression against Chinese nationalists and established the U.S. policy of defending Taiwan .
When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 , he had to play catch-up in the space race .
Eisenhower forced Israel , the UK , and France to end their invasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis of 1956 .
In 1958 , he sent 15,000 US troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser -inspired revolution .
Near the end of his term , his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident .
On the domestic front , he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege .
He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President , Richard Nixon .
He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security .
Among his enduring innovations , he launched the Interstate Highway System ; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , which led to the internet , among many invaluable outputs ; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , driving peaceful discovery in space ; the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act ; and encouraging peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act .
In social policy , he sent federal troops to Little Rock , Arkansas , for the first time since Reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools .
He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote .
He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the Supreme Court .
He was the first term-limited president in accordance with the 22nd Amendment .
Eisenhower 's two terms were peaceful ones for the most part and saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958–59 .
Eisenhower is often ranked highly among the U.S. Presidents .
how many jets fly with the president 's plane
Air Force One is the official air traffic control call sign of a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the President of the United States .
In common parlance the term refers to those Air Force aircraft specifically designed , built , and used for the purpose of transporting the president .
The Presidential aircraft is a prominent symbol of the American presidency and its power .
The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the President arose in 1943 , when officials of the United States Army Air Forces – the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force – became concerned with relying on commercial airlines to transport the President .
A C-87 Liberator Express was reconfigured for use as a presidential transport ; however , it was rejected by the Secret Service amid concerns over the aircraft 's safety record .
A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use ; this aircraft , dubbed the Sacred Cow , transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 , and was subsequently used for another two years by President Harry S. Truman .
The `` Air Force One '' call sign was created after a 1953 incident during which a flight carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same call sign .
Several aircraft have been used as Air Force One since the creation of the presidential fleet , including two Boeing 707s introduced in the 1960s and 1970s , respectively ; since 1990 , the presidential fleet has consisted of two Boeing VC-25As – specifically configured , highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft .
The Air Force is looking into replacing the two VC-25 aircraft with three replacement aircraft beginning in 2017 .

what does automatic paper feeder on printers mean
A scanner with Duplexing Automatic Document Feeder .
In multifunction or all-in-one printers , fax machines , photocopiers and scanners , an automatic document feeder or ADF is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page at a time into a scanner or copier , allowing the user to scan , and thereby copy , print , or fax , multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page .
Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen ( the `` glass '' ) or through a document feeder .
The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF , allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes .
Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines , some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner , faxing multi-page documents to themselves .
Document feeders are described by speed , in pages per minute or ppm , and capacity , usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200 .
There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided ( duplex ) scanning : a reversing automatic document feeder or RADF scans one side of a page , then flips it and scans the other side .
A duplexing automatic document feeder or DADF scans both sides in one pass .
The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals .
RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute ( IPM ) , the number of sides they can scan each minute .
how many acres is fair park
Fair Park is a recreational and educational complex located in Dallas , Texas ( USA ) .
The complex is registered as a Dallas Landmark , National Historic Landmark and is home to nine museums , six performance facilities , a lagoon , and the largest Ferris wheel in North America .

Being designated as a Great Place in America , Fair Park was one of only ten cities chosen in 2011 .
what county is san jose in ?
San Jose ( ; Spanish : St. Joseph ) is the third-largest city in California , the tenth-largest in the U.S. , and the county seat of Santa Clara County which is located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay .
San Jose is the largest city within Silicon Valley , which is a major component of the greater San Francisco Bay Area , a region of 8.4 million people and the fifth largest metropolitan area ( CSA ) in the United States .
It is the largest city in Northern California .
San Jose was founded on November 29 , 1777 , as El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe , the first civilian town in the Spanish colony of Nueva California , which later became Alta California .
The city served as a farming community to support Spanish military installations at San Francisco and Monterey .
When California gained statehood in 1850 , San Jose served as its first capital .
After more than 150 years as a small farming city , San Jose and the surrounding Santa Clara Valley became the last ( and largest ) contiguous area of undeveloped land surrounding the San Francisco Bay .
San Jose experienced increased demand for housing from soldiers and veterans returning from World War II .
San Jose then continued its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area .
The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center , to an urbanized metropolitan area .
By the 1990s , San Jose 's location within the booming local technology industry earned the city its nickname , Capital of Silicon Valley .
San Jose now maintains global city status and is the largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area in terms of population , land area , and industrial development .
The U.S. Census Bureau reported the population of the city to be 945,942 as of the 2010 Census .
As of April 2013 , the estimated population of San Jose was 984,000 .
San Jose , along with the Santa Clara Valley , experienced about half a century of spectacular suburban sprawl , with characteristics of intense urbanization similar to the Los Angeles area of Southern California .
The city has taken definite steps to avoid becoming `` L.A. North '' .
However , the sprawl in San Jose is worse than in Los Angeles by measures such as population density and public transit safety , investment , and ridership .
how is power divided in in european countries
Europe depicted by Antwerp cartographer Abraham Ortelius in 1595
The history of Europe covers the people inhabiting the European continent since it was first populated in prehistoric times to present , with the first Homo sapiens arriving between 45,000 and 25,000 BC .
The earliest settlers to Prehistoric Europe came during the paleolithic era .
The arrival of agriculture around 7000 BC ushered in the neolithic age .
Neolithic Europe lasted for 4000 years , overlapping with metal-using cultures that gradually spread throughout the continent .
Technological advances during the prehistoric age tended to arrive from the Middle East , spreading gradually to the northwest .
Some of the best-known civilizations of prehistoric Europe were Minoan and Mycenaean , which flourished during the Bronze Age until they collapsed in a short period of time around 1200 BC .
The period known as classical antiquity began with the rise of the city-states of Ancient Greece .
Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of Alexander the Great , spreading throughout Asia .
Northern and western Europe were dominated by the La Tène culture , a precursor to the Celts .
Rome , a small city-state traditionally founded in 753 BC , would grow to become the Roman Republic in 509 BC and would succeed Greek culture as the dominant Mediterranean civilization .
The events of the rule of Julius Caesar led to reorganization of the Republic into the Roman Empire .
The empire was later divided by the emperor Diocletian into the Western and Eastern empires .
During the later years of the Roman Empire , the Germanic peoples of northern Europe grew in strength and repeated attacks led to the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 , a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the Middle Ages .
During the Middle Ages , the Eastern Roman Empire survived , though modern historians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire .
In Western Europe , Germanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own .
Of all of the Germanic peoples , the Franks would rise to a position of Hegemony over western Europe , the Frankish Empire reaching its peak under Charlemagne around AD 800 .
Francia was divided into several parts ; West Francia would evolve into the Kingdom of France , while East Francia would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire , a precursor to modern Germany .
The British Isles were the site of several large-scale migrations .
Native Celtic peoples had been marginalized during the period of Roman Britain , and when the Romans abandoned the British Isles during the 400s , waves of Germanic Anglo-Saxons migrated to southern Britain and established a series of petty kingdoms in what would eventually develop into the Kingdom of England by AD 927 .
During this period , the Kingdom of Poland and Kingdom of Hungary ( 1000–1945 ) were organized as well .
The Viking Age , a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples , dominated the period from the late 700s to the middle 1000s .
Chief among the Viking states was the Empire of Cnut the Great , a Danish leader who would become king of England , Denmark , and Norway .
The Normans , a Viking people who settled in Northern France and founded the Duchy of Normandy , would have a significant impact on many parts of Europe , from the Norman conquest of England to Southern Italy and Sicily .
Another Scandinavian people , the Rus ' people , would go on to found Kievan Rus ' , an early state which was a precursor for the modern country of Russia .
As the Viking Age drew to a close , the period known as the Crusades , a series of religiously-motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into Christian rule , began .
Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern Mediterranean .
These were all short-lived .
The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe .
Their Sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire .

what cars have smart key systems
Nissan Intelligent Key®
A smart key is an electronic access and authorization system which is available as an option or standard in several cars .
It was first developed by Siemens in the mid-1990s and introduced by Mercedes-Benz under the name `` Keyless Go '' in 1998 on the W220 S-Class following its design patent filed by Daimler-Benz on May 17 , 1997 .
what channel is univision
Univisión ( ) is a Spanish-language television network in the United States .
The network is primarily dedicated for Latin American families who reside in the United States .
It has the largest audience of Spanish-language television viewers in the world according to Nielsen ratings .
Randy Falco , ( CEO as of June 29 , 2011 ) COO , has been in charge of the company since the departure of Univision Communications president and CEO Joe Uva in April 2010 .
In recent years the network has reached parity with the U.S. 's five major English-language television networks , and is often a strong fifth , outranking The CW , with some fourth-place weekly placings , and as of 2012 , even first place rankings for individual programs over all five English networks due to the network 's consistent schedule of new telenovelas all 52 weeks of the year .
Univisión is headquartered in New York , and has its major studios , production facilities , and operations in Doral , Florida , a suburb of Miami .
In 2009 , another television studio was announced , Univision Studios , to be built in Doral .
Univision is available on cable and satellite in most of the country , with local stations in over 50 markets with large Hispanic and Latino populations and a national cable network feed distributed in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally-based station .
Most of these stations air full local news and other local programming in addition to network shows , and in major markets such as Los Angeles , New York , and Miami the local newscasts carried by the network 's owned-and-operated station ( O & O ) stations are equally competitive with their English-language counterparts ratings-wise .
Univisión was acquired on March 29 , 2007 by a consortium led by Haim Saban 's Saban Capital Group ( who had previously owned the entity Saban Entertainment ) , TPG Capital , L.P. , Providence Equity Partners , Madison Dearborn Partners , and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $ 13.7 billion or $ 36.25 per share plus $ 1.4 billion in acquired debt .
The buyout left the company with a debt level of twelve times its annual cash flow , which was twice the norm in buyouts done over the previous two years .
what kind of material was able to survive near the sun during the development of the solar system
Artist 's conception of a protoplanetary disk
The formation and of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud .
Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre , forming the Sun , while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets , moons , asteroids , and other small Solar System bodies formed .
This widely accepted model , known as the nebular hypothesis , was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg , Immanuel Kant , and Pierre-Simon Laplace .
Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy , physics , geology , and planetary science .
Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s , the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations .
The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation .
Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets , while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets .
Still others , as the Earth 's Moon , may be the result of giant collisions .
Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System .
The positions of the planets often shifted , and planets have switched places .
This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System 's early evolution .
In roughly 5 billion years , the Sun will cool and expand outward many times its current diameter ( becoming a red giant ) , before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf .
In the far distant future , the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun 's retinue of planets .
Some planets will be destroyed , others ejected into interstellar space .
Ultimately , over the course of tens of billions of years , it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it .
how is kafka like the trial
The Trial ( Kafka 's original German title : , later as , and ) is a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914 and 1915 but not published until 1925 .
One of Kafka 's best-known works , it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote , inaccessible authority , with the nature of his crime revealed to neither him nor the reader .
Like Kafka 's other novels , The Trial was never completed , although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end .
Because of this there are certain inconsistencies which exist within the novel , such as disparities in timing in addition to other discontinuities in narration .
After Kafka 's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede .
The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature , Marbach am Neckar , Germany .
In 1999 , the book was listed in Le Mondes 100 Books of the Century and as No . 2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century .

what does new jersey flag presents
The Coat of arms of the State of New Jersey includes:
A shield with three plows emblazoned , representative of New Jersey 's agricultural tradition .
A forward-facing knight 's helmet .
A horse 's head as the crest of the helmet .
The female figures Liberty and Ceres , representative of the state 's motto ( see next item ) .
Liberty is holding a staff supporting a `` liberty cap `` ; Ceres is holding an overflowing cornucopia .
The streamer at the foot of the emblem contains the State Motto of New Jersey , `` Liberty and Prosperity '' , and the year of statehood , 1776 .
It was originally designed by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1777 and was modified slightly in 1928 .
The seal is the central motif in the flag of New Jersey and the Great Seal of the State of New Jersey .
The Coat of arms contains a horse 's head .
A helmet showing that New Jersey governs itself accordingly and three plows on a shield referring to the State 's agriculture tradition , giving it the nickname `` Garden State '' .
The two Goddesses represent the State motto , `` Liberty and Prosperity '' .
Liberty is on the left .
She is holding a staff with a liberty cap on it , and the word liberty underneath her .
The goddess on the right is Ceres , goddess of agriculture .
She is holding a cornucopia with prosperity written below her .
According to the minutes of the New Jersey General Assembly for March 11 , 1896 , the date in which the Assembly officially approved the flag as the state emblem , the buff color is due indirectly to George Washington , who had ordered on October 2 , 1779 , that the uniform coats of the New Jersey Continental Line be dark ( Jersey ) blue , with buff facings .
Buff-colored facings had until then been reserved only for his own uniform and those of other Continental generals and their aides .
Then , on February 28 , 1780 , the Continental War Officers in Philadelphia directed that the uniform coat facings of all regiments were to be the same as the background color of the regiments ' state flag .
The seal is described in New Jersey statute Title 52 , §2-1:
how many people have song we can work it out

how old a child pedophile crime
As a medical diagnosis , pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in persons 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive sexual interest toward prepubescent children ( generally age 11 years or younger , though specific diagnosis criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13 ) .
An adolescent who is 16 years of age or older must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child before the attraction can be diagnosed as pedophilia .
The term has a range of definitions , as found in psychiatry , psychology , the vernacular , and law enforcement .
The International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) defines pedophilia as a `` disorder of adult personality and behaviour '' in which there is a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age .
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , it is a paraphilia in which adults or adolescents 16 years of age or older have intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that they have either acted on or which cause them distress or interpersonal difficulty .
In popular usage , pedophilia means any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse , often termed `` pedophilic behavior '' .
For example , The American Heritage Stedman 's Medical Dictionary states , `` Pedophilia is the act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children . ''
This common use application also extends to the sexual interest in and sexual contact with pubescent or post-pubescent minors .
Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse commonly exhibit the disorder , some offenders do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards for pedophilia and these standards pertain to prepubescents .
Additionally , not all pedophiles actually commit such abuse .
Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century .
A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s .
Although mostly documented in men , there are also women who exhibit the disorder , and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles .
No cure for pedophilia has been developed , but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse .
In the United States , following Kansas v. Hendricks , sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders , particularly pedophilia , can be subject to indefinite civil commitment , under various state laws ( generically called SVP laws ) and the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 .
At present , the exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established .
Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities , and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies .
In the contexts of forensic psychology and law enforcement , a variety of typologies have been suggested to categorize pedophiles according to behavior and motivations .

The Holocaust ( from the Greek ' : hólos , `` whole '' and kaustós , `` burnt '' ) also known as the Shoah ( Hebrew : , HaShoah , `` catastrophe '' ; Yiddish : , Churben or Hurban , from the Hebrew for `` destruction '' ) , was the mass murder or genocide of approximately six million Jews during World War II , a programme of systematic state-sponsored murder by Nazi Germany , led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party , throughout German-occupied territory .
Of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe before the Holocaust , approximately two-thirds were killed .
Over one million Jewish children were killed in the Holocaust , as were approximately two million Jewish women and three million Jewish men .
A network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and German-occupied territory were used to concentrate , hold , and kill Jews and other victims .
Some scholars argue that the mass murder of the Romani and people with disabilities should be included in the definition , and some use the common noun `` holocaust '' to describe other Nazi mass murders , including those of Soviet prisoners of war , Polish and Soviet civilians , and homosexuals .
Recent estimates based on figures obtained since the fall of the Soviet Union indicates some ten to eleven million civilians and prisoners of war were intentionally murdered by the Nazi regime .
The persecution and genocide were carried out in stages .
Various laws to remove the Jews from civil society , most prominently the Nuremberg Laws , were enacted in Germany years before the outbreak of World War II .
Concentration camps were established in which inmates were subjected to slave labor until they died of exhaustion or disease .
Where Germany conquered new territory in eastern Europe , specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings .
The occupiers required Jews and Romani to be confined in overcrowded ghettos before being transported by freight train to extermination camps where , if they survived the journey , most were systematically killed in gas chambers .
Every arm of Germany 's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics that led to the genocides , turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called `` a genocidal state '' .

How did the flag of chile get created
The national flag of Chile , consists of two unequal horizontal bands of white and red and a blue square the same height as the white band in the canton , which bears a white five-pointed star in the center .
It was adopted on 18 October 1817 .
The Chilean flag is also known in Spanish as La Estrella Solitaria ( The Lone Star ) .
The star represents a guide to progress and honor ; blue symbolizes the sky and the Pacific Ocean , white is for the snow-covered Andes , and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence .
According to the epic poem La Araucana , the colors were derived from those from the flag flown by the Mapuche during the Arauco War .

How many wide is the state of virginia
Virginia ( ) , officially the Commonwealth of Virginia , is a U.S. state located in the South Atlantic region of the United States .
Virginia is nicknamed the `` Old Dominion '' and the `` Mother of Presidents '' after the eight U.S. presidents born there .
The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna .
The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; and Virginia Beach is the most populous city .
Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision .
The wealthiest is Loudoun County .
The Commonwealth 's population is over eight million .
The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan .
In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony .
Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy .
Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War , during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia 's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia .
Although the Commonwealth was under conservative single-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia .
The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere .
The state government has been repeatedly ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States .
It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally , manages local roads , and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms .
Virginia 's economy has many sectors : agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley ; federal agencies in Northern Virginia , including the headquarters of the Department of Defense and CIA ; and military facilities in Hampton Roads , the site of the region 's main seaport .
Virginia 's public schools and many colleges and universities have contributed to growing media and technology sectors .
As a result , computer chips have become the state 's leading export .

how well did `` Brenda 's got a baby '' do on the charts
`` Brenda 's Got A Baby '' is the solo debut single by Tupac Shakur , and tenth track from his debut album , 2Pacalypse Now .
The song , which features R & B singer Dave Hollister , is about a twelve year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto , has a baby , and is incapable of supporting it .
The song explores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on the young mothers and their families .
Like many of Shakur 's songs , `` Brenda 's Got a baby '' draws from the plight of the impoverished .
Using Brenda to represent young mothers in general , Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby 's father , the government , and society in general .
Shakur wrote the song when he read a newspaper article about a twelve-year-old girl who got pregnant from her cousin and , because she did not want her parents to know about the baby , threw it in a trash can .

what did dada artists think of art in past museums
Cover of the first edition of the publication Dada by Tristan Tzara ; Zurich , 1917
Dada ( ) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century .
Many claim Dada began in Zurich , Switzerland in 1916 , spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter but the height of New York Dada was the year before in 1915 .
To quote Dona Budd 's The Language of Art Knowledge , Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of World War I .
This international movement was begun by a group of artist and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich .
Dada rejected reason and logic , prizing nonsense , irrationality and intuition .
The origin of the name Dada is unclear ; some believe that it is a nonsensical word .
Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco 's frequent use of the words da , da , meaning yes , yes in the Romanian language .
Another theory says that the name `` Dada '' came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada ' , a French word for 'hobbyhorse ' .
The movement primarily involved visual arts , literature , poetry , art manifestoes , art theory , theatre , and graphic design , and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works .
In addition to being anti-war , Dada was also anti- bourgeois and had political affinities with the radical left .
Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media .
Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah Höch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , Georg Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , and Hans Richter , among others .
The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau réalisme , pop art and Fluxus .
Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry , a starting point for performance art , a prelude to postmodernism , an influence on pop art , a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism .
How much energy can be passed along each trophic level
First trophic level .
The plants in this image , and the algae and phytoplankton in the lake , are primary producers .
They take nutrients from the soil or the water , and manufacture their own food by photosynthesis , using energy from the sun .
The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food chain .
The word trophic derives from the Greek τροφή ( trophē ) referring to food or feeding .
A food chain represents a succession of organisms that eat another organism and are , in turn , eaten themselves .
The number of steps an organism is from the start of the chain is a measure of its trophic level .
Food chains start at trophic level 1 with primary producers such as plants , move to herbivores at level 2 , predators at level 3 and typically finish with carnivores or apex predators at level 4 or 5 .
The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow , or a food `` web . ''
Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths .
what can silk be used for
Four of the most important domesticated silk moths .
Top to bottom : Bombyx mori , Hyalophora cecropia , Antheraea pernyi , Samia cynthia .
From Meyers Konversations-Lexikon ( 1885-1892 )
A silk-producing raspy cricket .
Silk is a natural protein fibre , some forms of which can be woven into textiles .
The protein fibre of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons .
The best-known type of silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity ( sericulture ) .
The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism -like structure of the silk fibre , which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles , thus producing different colors .
Silks are produced by several other insects , but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing .
There has been some research into other silks , which differ at the molecular level .
Many silks are mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis , but some adult insects such as webspinners produce silk , and some insects such as raspy crickets produce silk throughout their lives .
Silk production also occurs in Hymenoptera ( bees , wasps , and ants ) , silverfish , mayflies , thrips , leafhoppers , beetles , lacewings , fleas , flies and midges .
Other types of arthropod produce silk , most notably various arachnids such as spiders ( see spider silk ) .

what do cyberstalkers do
Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual , a group of individuals , or an organization .
It may include the making of false accusations or statements of fact ( as in defamation ) , monitoring , making threats , identity theft , damage to data or equipment , the solicitation of minors for sex , or gathering information that may be used to harass .
The definition of `` harassment '' must meet the criterion that a reasonable person , in possession of the same information , would regard it as sufficient to cause another reasonable person distress .
Cyberstalking is different from spatial or offline stalking in that it occurs through the use of electronic communications technology such as the internet .
However , it sometimes leads to it , or is accompanied by it .
Both are criminal offenses .
Cyberstalking shares important characteristics with offline stalking .
Many stalkers – online or off – are motivated by a desire to control their victims .
A cyberstalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows .
A cyberstalker may be anonymous and may solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target .
Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws , slander laws , and harassment laws .
A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order , probation , or even criminal penalties against the assailant , including jail .

what did 7 year old Hitler look like
Adolf Hitler ( ; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945 ) was an Austrian -born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party ( ( NSDAP ) ; National Socialist German Workers Party ) .
He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany ( as Führer und Reichskanzler ) from 1934 to 1945 .
Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany , World War II in Europe , and the Holocaust .
Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I .
He joined the German Workers ' Party ( precursor of the NSDAP ) in 1919 , and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921 .
In 1923 , he attempted a coup d'état in Munich , known as the Beer Hall Putsch .
The failed coup resulted in Hitler 's imprisonment , during which time he wrote his memoir , Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ) .
After his release in 1924 , Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism , antisemitism , and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda .
After his appointment as chancellor in 1933 , he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich , a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism .
Hitler 's aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe .
To this end , his foreign and domestic policies had the aim of seizing Lebensraum ( `` living space '' ) for the Germanic people .
He directed the rearmament of Germany and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in September 1939 , resulting in the outbreak of World War II in Europe .
Under Hitler 's rule , in 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa .
In 1943 , Germany had been forced onto the defensive and suffered a series of escalating defeats .
In the final days of the war , during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 , Hitler married his long-time partner , Eva Braun .
On 30 April 1945 , less than two days later , the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army , and their corpses were burned .
Hitler 's aggressive foreign policy is considered the main cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe .
His antisemitic policies and racially motivated ideology resulted in the deaths of at least 5.5 million Jews , and millions of other people deemed racially inferior .
how many domain names are registered
thumb
A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy , authority , or control on the Internet .
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .
Technically , any name registered in the DNS is a domain name .
Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes .
In general , a domain name represents an Internet Protocol ( IP ) resource , such as a personal computer used to access the Internet , a server computer hosting a web site , or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet .
Domain names are organized in subordinate levels ( subdomains ) of the DNS root domain , which is nameless .
The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains ( TLDs ) , including the generic top-level domains ( gTLDs ) , such as the prominent domains com , info , net and org , and the country code top-level domains ( ccTLDs ) .
Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet , create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites .
The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public .
A fully qualified domain name ( FQDN ) is a domain name that is completely specified in the hierarchy of the DNS , having no omitted parts .
Domain names are usually written in lowercase , although labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive .

what freezes faster ? hot or cold water ?
The Mpemba effect , named after Tanzanian student Erasto Mpemba , is the assertion that warmer water can freeze faster than colder water .
Although there is anecdotal support for the effect , there is no agreement on exactly what the effect is and under what circumstances it occurs .
There have been reports of similar phenomena since ancient times , although with insufficient detail for the claims to be replicated .
The phenomenon seems contrary to thermodynamics , but a number of possible explanations for the effect have been proposed .
Further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of `` freezing '' and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect .

what affects the money supply
In economics , the money supply or money stock , is the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time .
There are several ways to define `` money , '' but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits ( depositors ' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions ) .
Money supply data are recorded and published , usually by the government or the central bank of the country .
Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in money supply because of its effects on the price level , inflation , the exchange rate and the business cycle .
That relation between money and prices is historically associated with the quantity theory of money .
There is strong empirical evidence of a direct relation between money-supply growth and long-term price inflation , at least for rapid increases in the amount of money in the economy .
That is , a country such as Zimbabwe which saw rapid increases in its money supply also saw rapid increases in prices ( hyperinflation ) .
This is one reason for the reliance on monetary policy as a means of controlling inflation .
The nature of this causal chain is the subject of contention .
Some heterodox economists argue that the money supply is endogenous ( determined by the workings of the economy , not by the central bank ) and that the sources of inflation must be found in the distributional structure of the economy .
In addition , those economists seeing the central bank 's control over the money supply as feeble say that there are two weak links between the growth of the money supply and the inflation rate .
First , in the aftermath of a recession , when many resources are underutilized , an increase in the money supply can cause a sustained increase in real production instead of inflation .
Second , if the velocity of money , i.e. , the ratio between nominal GDP and money supply , changes , an increase in the money supply could have either no effect , an exaggerated effect , or an unpredictable effect on the growth of nominal GDP .

What Causes Brain Freeze
An ice-cream headache , also known as brain freeze , cold-stimulus headache , or its given scientific name sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia ( meaning `` nerve pain of the sphenopalatine ganglion `` ) , is a form of brief cranial pain or headache commonly associated with consumption ( particularly quick consumption ) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream and ice pops .
It is caused by having something cold touch the roof of the mouth ( palate ) , and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels or a `` referring `` of pain from the roof of the mouth to the head .
The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor .
There are people who can not experience `` brain freeze '' or similar symptoms .
The term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least 31 January 1937 , contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book We did n't ask Utopia : a Quaker family in Soviet Russia .
The first published use of the term brain freeze , as it pertains to cold-induced headaches , was on 27 May 1991 .
what does auld lang syne mean
`` Auld Lang Syne '' ( : note `` s '' rather than `` z '' ) is a Scots poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song ( Roud # 6294 ) .
It is well known in many countries , especially in the English-speaking world ; its traditional use being to celebrate the start of the New Year at the stroke of midnight .
By extension , it is also sung at funerals , graduations and as a farewell or ending to other occasions .
The international Boy Scout youth movement , in many countries , uses it as a close to jamborees and other functions .
The song 's Scots title may be translated into English literally as `` old long since '' , or more idiomatically , `` long long ago '' , `` days gone by '' or `` old times '' .
Consequently `` For auld lang syne '' , as it appears in the first line of the chorus , might be loosely translated as `` for ( the sake of ) old times '' .
The phrase `` Auld Lang Syne '' is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton ( 1570–1638 ) , Allan Ramsay ( 1686–1757 ) , and James Watson ( 1711 ) as well as older folk songs predating Burns .
Matthew Fitt uses the phrase `` In the days of auld lang syne '' as the equivalent of `` Once upon a time ...
`` in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language .

what happened to the officer in bart shooting
Oscar Grant was fatally shot by BART police officer Johannes Mehserle in Oakland , California , United States , in the early morning hours of New Year 's Day 2009 .
Responding to reports of a fight on a crowded Bay Area Rapid Transit train returning from San Francisco , BART Police officers detained Oscar Grant and several other passengers on the platform at the Fruitvale BART Station .
Officer Johannes Mehserle and another officer were restraining Grant , who was prostrate and allegedly resisting arrest .
Officer Mehserle stood and , according to witnesses , said : `` Get back , I 'm gon na tase him . ''
Then Mehserle drew his gun and shot Grant once in the back ; Mehserle appeared stunned , put his hands to his head and exclaimed , `` Oh , my God ! ''
During his court testimony , Mehserle said that Grant then exclaimed , `` You shot me ! ''
Grant turned out to be unarmed ; he was pronounced dead the next morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland .
The events were captured on multiple digital video and cell phone cameras .
The footage was disseminated to media outlets and to various websites , where it was watched millions of times .
The following days saw both peaceful and violent protests .
The shooting has been variously labeled an involuntary manslaughter and a summary execution .
On January 13 , Alameda County prosecutors charged Mehserle with murder for the shooting .
He resigned his position and pleaded not guilty .
The trial began on June 10 , 2010 .
Michael Rains , Mehserle 's criminal defense attorney , argued that Mehserle mistakenly shot Grant with his pistol , intending to use his Taser when he saw Grant reaching for his waistband .
Pretrial filings argue that his client did not commit first-degree murder and asked a Los Angeles judge to instruct the jury to limit its deliberations to either second-degree murder or acquittal .
Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris filed a $ 25 million wrongful death claim against BART on behalf of Grant 's family .
On July 8 , 2010 , the jury returned its verdict : Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter .
Initial protests against the ruling were peacefully organized ; looting , arson , destruction of property , and small riots broke out after dark .
Nearly 80 people were eventually arrested .
On Friday , July 9 , 2010 , the U.S. Justice Department opened a civil rights case against Mehserle ; the federal government can prosecute him independently for the same act under the separate sovereigns exception to double jeopardy .
The Department of Justice will be working with the U.S. Attorney 's office in San Francisco and the FBI .
On November 5 , 2010 , Mehserle was sentenced to two years , minus time served .
He served his time in the Los Angeles County Jail , occupying a private cell away from other prisoners .
He was released on June 13 , 2011 and is now on parole .
how did lena horne impact the harlem renaissance
Major representatives of the Harlem Renaissance .
The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural movement that spanned the 1920s .
At the time , it was known as the `` New Negro Movement '' , named after the 1925 anthology by Alain Locke .
Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City , many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance .
The Harlem Renaissance is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid-1930s .
Many of its ideas lived on much longer .
The zenith of this `` flowering of Negro literature '' , as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance , was placed between 1924 ( the year that Opportunity : A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance ) and 1929 ( the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression ) .

The history of Africa begins with the prehistory of Africa and the emergence of Homo sapiens in East Africa , continuing into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states .
Some early evidence of agriculture in Africa dates from 16,000 BCE , and metallurgy from about 4000 BCE .
The recorded history of early civilization arose in Egypt , and later in Nubia , the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa .
During the Middle Ages , Islam spread through the regions .
Crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel , a major center of Muslim culture was Timbuktu .
Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the Nok culture , Mali Empire , Ashanti Empire , Kingdom of Mapungubwe , Kingdom of Sine , Kingdom of Saloum , Kingdom of Baol , Kingdom of Zimbabwe , Kingdom of Kongo , Ancient Carthage , Numidia , Mauretania , the Aksumite Empire , the Ajuuraan State and the Adal Sultanate .
From the late 15th century , Europeans and Arabs took slaves from West , Central and Southeast Africa overseas in the African slave trade .
European colonization of Africa developed rapidly in the Scramble for Africa of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent , as well as a weakened Europe after the Second World War ; decolonization took place .
Africa 's history has been challenging for researchers in the field of African studies because of the scarcity of written sources in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa .
Scholarly techniques such as the recording of oral history , historical linguistics , archaeology and genetics have been crucial .
how many times has a player hit for the cycle
Curry Foley was the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit for the cycle .
In baseball , hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter hitting a single , a double , a triple , and a home run in the same game .
Collecting the hits in that order is known as a `` natural cycle '' .
Cycles are uncommon in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , and have occurred 294 times since the first by Curry Foley in 1882 .
The cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter ( 279 occurrences in MLB history ) ; it has been called `` one of the rarest '' and `` most difficult feats '' in baseball .
Based on 2009 offensive levels , the probability of an average MLB player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is approximately 0.00590 % ; this corresponds to about 2.5 cycles in a 162-game season with 30 teams .
In other baseball leagues , the cycle is achieved less frequently .
Through September 4 , 2008 , 62 players in Nippon Professional Baseball ( NPB ) , the top-level baseball organization in Japan , have hit for the cycle , the most recent being Michihiro Ogasawara .
Two players have hit for the cycle on the same day once in NPB history ; this has occurred twice in MLB history .
One NPB player has also hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game .
No player has ever hit for the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game or the postseason .
how do africans view the slave trade
The main slave routes in medieval Africa .
This article discusses systems , history , and effects of slavery within Africa .
See Arab slave trade , Atlantic slave trade , Maafa , and Slavery in contemporary Africa for other discussions .
`` Slave transport in Africa '' .
Europeans usually did not enter the interior regions .
Slavery in Africa has existed throughout the continent for many centuries , and continues in the current day .
Systems of servitude and slavery were common in many parts of the continent , as they were in much of the ancient world .
In most African societies where slavery was prevalent , the enslaved people were largely treated as indentured servants and not treated as chattel slaves .
When the Arab slave trade and Atlantic slave trade began , many of the local slave systems changed and began supplying captives for slave markets outside of Africa .
Slavery in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms and some of these do not clearly fit the definitions of slavery elsewhere in the world .
Debt slavery , enslavement of war captives , military slavery , and criminal slavery were all practiced in various parts of Africa .
Although there had been some trans-Saharan trade from the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa to other regions , slavery was a small part of the economic life of many societies in Africa until the introduction of transcontinental slave trades ( Arab and Atlantic ) .
Slave practices were again transformed with European colonization of Africa and the formal abolition of slavery in the early 1900s .
What does the Networking tab in task manager show ?
Windows Task Manager is a task manager or System monitor application included with the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems that provides limited information about computer performance and running applications , processes and CPU usage , commit charge and memory information , network activity and statistics , logged-in users , and system services ( and as often is the case with software tools provided by Microsoft for Windows , 3rd party software is available which fills the requirements more thoroughly , e.g , `` Process Explorer '' , `` Extended Task Manager '' , `` Anvir Task Manager '' , `` Process Hacker '' , and `` System Explorer '' ) .
The Task Manager can also be used to set process priorities , processor affinity , forcibly terminate processes , and shut down , restart , hibernate or log off from Windows .
Windows Task Manager was introduced with Windows NT 4.0 .
Previous versions of Windows NT included the Task List application , which had far fewer features .
The task list was capable of listing currently running processes and killing them , or creating a new process .
In Windows XP only , a Shutdown menu is also present that allows access to Standby , Hibernate , Turn off , Restart , Log Off and Switch User .
Earlier versions of Microsoft Windows ( Microsoft Windows 3.x , Windows 95 , Windows 98 ) had a program known as tasks to display the programs currently running .
This file was executed by running the taskman.exe file from the C : \Windows directory .

what goods are imported in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Sparsely populated in relation to its area , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) is home to a vast potential of natural resources and mineral wealth , its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US $ 24 trillion , yet the economy of the DRC has declined drastically since the mid-1980s .
At the time of its independence in 1960 , DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa ; it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive .
what causes an afterimage
If the viewer stares at this image for 20–60 seconds and stares at a white object , a negative afterimage will appear ( in this case , it will be cyan on magenta ) .
This can also be achieved by the viewer closing his/her eyes and tilting their head up .
An afterimage or ghost image or image burn-in is an optical illusion that refers to an image continuing to appear in one 's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased .
One of the most common afterimages is the bright glow that seems to float before one 's eyes after looking into a light source for a few seconds .
Closing the eye can help achieve a better sense of the color in its own aspect .
Afterimages come in two forms , negative ( inverted ) and positive ( retaining original color ) .
The process behind positive afterimages is unknown , though thought to be related to neural adaptation .
On the other hand , negative afterimages are a retinal phenomenon and are well understood .

what does it mean if i 'm flat footed ?
Flat feet ( also called pes planus or fallen arches ) is a formal reference to a medical condition in which the arch of the foot collapses , with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground .
In some individuals ( an estimated 20–30 % of the general population ) the arch simply never develops in one foot ( unilaterally ) or both feet ( bilaterally ) .
Three studies ( see citations below in military section ) of military recruits have shown no evidence of later increased injury , or foot problems , due to flat feet , in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems .
However , these studies can not be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages .
They also can not be applied to persons whose flat feet are associated with foot symptoms , or certain symptoms in other parts of the body ( such as the leg or back ) possibly referable to the foot .
what age group is generation x
Generation X , commonly abbreviated to Gen X , is the generation born after the Western post-World War II baby boom .

The term was popularized by Douglas Coupland 's 1991 novel Generation X : Tales for an Accelerated Culture .
Before that , it had been used for various subcultures or countercultures after the 1950s .
how do you heal a bed sore
Pressure ulcers , also known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores , are localized injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence , as a result of pressure , or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction .
Most commonly this will be the sacrum , coccyx , heels or the hips , but other sites such as the elbows , knees , ankles or the back of the cranium can be affected .
The cause of pressure ulcers is pressure applied to soft tissue so that blood flow to the soft tissue is completely or partially obstructed .
Shear is also a cause ; shear pulls on blood vessels that feed the skin .
Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in persons who are not moving about or are confined to wheelchairs .
It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development .
These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition , microclimate ( skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence ) , diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin , such as arteriosclerosis or diseases that reduce the feeling in the skin , such as paralysis or neuropathy .
The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person , medical conditions ( such as arteriosclerosis , diabetes or infection ) , smoking or medications such as antiinflammatory drugs .
Although often prevented and treatable if found early , pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill patients , frail elders , wheelchair users ( especially where spinal injury is involved ) and terminally ill patients .
Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by turning the patient regularly .
The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century .
In addition to turning and re-positioning the patient in bed or wheelchair , eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is very important .
The prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high , but improvements are being made .
According to the 2010 IPUP ( International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey ) conducted in Canada , there was a significant decrease in the overall facility-acquired prevalence of pressure ulcers from 2009-2010 .
Ulcers were most commonly identified at the sacral/coccyx ulcer location ; however , heel ulcers were the most common facility-acquired location in the survey .

how do I determine size needed for german world war 2 helmet
German Stahlhelm from World War II
Insignia of the Bolivian Army Colorados regiment , showing a Stahlhelm and two crossed bayonets
Stahlhelm ( plural , Stahlhelme ) is German for `` steel helmet '' .
The Imperial German Army began to replace the traditional boiled-leather Pickelhaube ( spiked combat helmet ) with the Stahlhelm during World War I in 1916 .
The term Stahlhelm refers both to a generic steel helmet , and more specifically to the distinctive ( and iconic ) German design .
The Stahlhelm , with its distinctive `` coal scuttle `` shape , was an instantly recognizable icon for military imagery and became a common element of military propaganda on both sides , just like the Pickelhaube before it .
Its name was also used by the Stahlhelm , a paramilitary nationalist organization established at the end of 1918 .

what cities are airline hubs
Frankfurt Airport serves as a hub city for Lufthansa and receives flights from Star Alliance carriers .
Airline hubs are airports ranked as large , medium , small , and non-hubs as one of the FAA airport categories which are re-evaluated every year based on number of commercial passengers .
The more common but informal use for the phrase airline hub is an airport that an airline uses as a transfer point to get passengers to their intended destination .
It is part of a hub and spoke model , where travelers moving between airports not served by direct flights change planes en route to their destinations .
This is as opposed to the Point to Point model .
Many hubs of the airlines are also situated at airports in the cities of the respective head offices .
Some airlines may use only a single hub , while other airlines use multiple hubs .
Hubs are used for both passenger flights as well as cargo flights .
Many airlines also use focus cities , which function much the same as hubs .
Airlines may also use secondary hubs , a non-technical term for large focus cities .
A hub in the middle of a route is more effective than at either end as connecting traffic more easily fills the plane - passengers prefer a one-stop ( two-leg ) route over a two-stop ( three-leg ) route .
what did sparta do around 650 bc
Hollow Lacedaemon .
Site of the Menelaion , the shrine to Helen and Menelaus constructed anciently in the Bronze Age city that stood on the hill of Therapne on the left bank of the Eurotas River overlooking the future site of Dorian Sparta .
Across the valley the successive ridges of Mount Taygetus are in evidence .
Sparta ( Doric Greek : ; Attic Greek : ) , or Lacedaemon , was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece , situated on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia , in south-eastern Peloponnese .
It emerged as a political entity around the 10th century BC , when the invading Dorians subjugated the local , non-Dorian population .
Around 650 BC , it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece .
Given its military pre-eminence , Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars .
Between 431 and 404 BC , Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War , from which it emerged victorious , though at great cost .
Sparta 's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta 's prominent role in Greece .
However , it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC .
It then underwent a long period of decline , especially in the Middle Ages , when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras .
Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives .
Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution , which completely focused on military training and excellence .
Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates ( Spartan citizens , who enjoyed full rights ) , Mothakes ( non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans ) , Perioikoi ( freedmen ) , and Helots ( state-owned serfs , enslaved non-Spartan local population ) .
Spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen , and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle .
Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world .
Sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day , as well as in the West following the revival of classical learning .
This love or admiration of Sparta is known as Laconism or Laconophilia .

how many people in world today
World population estimates from 1800 to 2100 , based on UN 2010 projections ( red , orange , green ) and US Census Bureau historical estimates ( black ) .
Actual recorded population figures are in blue .
According to the highest estimate , the world population may rise to 16 billion by 2100 ; according to the lowest estimate , it may decline to 6 billion .
The world population is the total number of living humans on Earth .
As of today , it is estimated to number billion by the United States Census Bureau ( USCB ) .
The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12 , 2012 .
According to a separate estimate by the United Nations Population Fund , it reached this milestone on October 31 , 2011 .
The world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350 , when it stood at around 370 million .
The highest rates of growth – global population increases above 1.8 % per year – were seen briefly during the 1950s , and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s .
The growth rate peaked at 2.2 % in 1963 , and had declined to 1.1 % by 2011 .
Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million , and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million , while deaths number 56 million per year , and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 .
Current projections show a continued increase in population in the near future ( but a steady decline in the population growth rate ) , with the global population expected to reach between 7.5 and 10.5 billion by 2050 .
Various longer-term estimates predict further growth , stagnation , or even overall decline in the global population by 2150 .
Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth , citing the growing pressures on the environment , global food supplies , and energy resources .
how many muscles in the body
Skeletal muscles homo sapiens
This is a table of muscles of the human anatomy .
There are approximately 642 skeletal muscles within the typical human , and almost every muscle constitutes one part of a pair of identical bilateral muscles , found on both sides , resulting in approximately 320 pairs of muscles , as presented in this article .
Nevertheless , the exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles differently , e.g . regarding what is defined as different parts of a single muscle or as several muscles .
Examples range from 640 to 850 .
The muscles of the human body can be categorized into a number of groups which include muscles relating to the head and neck , muscles of the torso or trunk , muscles of the upper limbs , and muscles of the lower limbs .
The action refers to the action of each muscle from the standard anatomical position .
In other positions , other actions may be performed .
how much does a gold bar weigh
A gold bar is a quantity of refined metallic gold of any shape that is made by a bar producer meeting standard conditions of manufacture , labeling , and record keeping .
Larger gold bars that are produced by pouring the molten metal into molds are called ingots .
Smaller bars may be manufactured by minting or stamping from appropriately rolled gold sheets .
The standard gold bar held as gold reserves by central banks and traded among bullion dealers is the 400-troy-ounce ( 12.4 kg or 438.9 ounces ) Good Delivery gold bar .
The kilobar , which is to say 1000 grams in mass , is the bar that is more manageable and is used extensively for trading and investment .
The premium on these bars when traded is very low over the spot value of the gold making it ideal for small transfers between banks and traders .
Most kilobars are flat , although some investors , particularly in Europe , prefer the brick shape .

what does the green mean on the mexican flag
The flag of Mexico ( Spanish : Bandera de México ) is a vertical tricolor of green , white , and red with the national coat of arms charged in the center of the white stripe .
While the meaning of the colors has changed over time , these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the country 's War of Independence , and subsequent First Mexican Empire .
The current flag was adopted in 1968 , but the overall design has been used since 1821 , when the First National Flag was created .
The current law of national symbols , Law on the National Arms , Flag , and Anthem , that governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1984 .
Red , white , and green are the colors of the national liberation army in Mexico .
The central emblem is the Aztec pictogram for Tenochtitlan ( now Mexico City ) , the center of their empire .
It recalls the legend that inspired the Aztecs to settle on what was originally a lake-island .
The form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968 .
A ribbon in the national colors is at the bottom of the coat of arms .
Throughout history , the flag has changed four times , as the design of the coat of arms and the length-width ratios of the flag have been modified .
However , the coat of arms has had the same features throughout : an eagle , holding a serpent in its talon , is perched on top of a prickly pear cactus ; the cactus is situated on a rock that rises above a lake .
The coat of arms is derived from an Aztec legend that their gods told them to build a city where they spot an eagle on a nopal eating a serpent , which is now Mexico City .
The current national flag , the Fourth National Flag , is also used as the Mexican naval ensign by ships registered in Mexico .

how often do elk have sex
The elk or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) is one of the largest species of deer in the world , and one of the largest land mammals in North America and eastern Asia .
It was long believed to be a subspecies of the European red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) , but evidence from a 2004 study of the mitochondrial DNA indicates that the two are distinct species .
This animal should not be confused with the larger moose ( Alces alces ) , to which the name `` elk '' applies in Eurasia .
Apart from the moose , the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar ( Rusa unicolor ) .
Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark .
Although native to North America and eastern Asia , they have adapted well to countries where they have been introduced , including Argentina , Australia , and New Zealand .
Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced .
Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year .
Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling ( sparring ) , and bugling , a loud series of vocalizations which establishes dominance over other males and attracts females .
Elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock .
Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely through vaccination , have had mixed success .

what does a lion need
The lion ( Panthera leo ) is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae .
With some males exceeding in weight , it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger .
Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia ( where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India ) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times .
Until the late Pleistocene , about 10,000 years ago , the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans .
They were found in most of Africa , across Eurasia from western Europe to India , and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru .
The lion is a vulnerable species , having seen a major population decline of 30–50 % over the past two decades in its African range .
Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks .
Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood , habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern .
Within Africa , the West African lion population is particularly endangered .
Lions live for 10–14 years in the wild , while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years .
In the wild , males seldom live longer than 10 years , as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity .
They typically inhabit savanna and grassland , although they may take to bush and forest .
Lions are unusually social compared to other cats .
A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males .
Groups of female lions typically hunt together , preying mostly on large ungulates .
Lions are apex and keystone predators , although they scavenge as opportunity allows .
While lions do not typically hunt humans , some have been known to do so .
Sleeping mainly during the day , lions are primarily nocturnal , although bordering on crepuscular in nature .
Highly distinctive , the male lion is easily recognised by its mane , and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture .
Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period , with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves , through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred .
It has been extensively depicted in sculptures , in paintings , on national flags , and in contemporary films and literature .
Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire , and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late 18th century .
Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies .
What Console Of The Seventh Generation Sells Best
In the history of video games , the seventh generation of consoles is the previous generation , and includes consoles released since late by Nintendo , Microsoft , and Sony .
For home consoles , the seventh generation began on 22 November 2005 with the release of Xbox 360 and continued with the release of PlayStation 3 on 11 November 2006 , and Wii on 19 November 2006 .
Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology .
The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at HD resolutions , the PlayStation 3 offered , in addition to FHD gaming , HD movie playback via a built-in 3D Blu-ray Disc player , and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks .
Joining Nintendo in the motion market , Sony released the PlayStation Move in September 2010 .
The PlayStation Move features motion sensing gaming , similar to that of the Wii .
Microsoft also joined Sony and Nintendo , with its Kinect .
Unlike the other two systems ( PlayStation 3 and Wii ) , Kinect does not use any controllers of any sort and makes the users the `` controller . ''
Having sold 8 million units in its first 60 days on the market , Kinect has claimed the Guinness World Record of being the `` fastest selling consumer electronics device '' .
While the Xbox 360 offers wired controllers as a standalone product , all PlayStation 3 controllers can be used in wired and wireless configurations .
Starting with handheld consoles , the seventh generation began on 21 November 2004 with the North American introduction of the Nintendo DS as a `` third pillar '' , alongside Nintendo 's existing Game Boy Advance and GameCube consoles .
The Nintendo DS ( NDS ) features a touch screen and built-in microphone , and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 ( Wi-Fi ) standards .
Additionally , the revised version of the NDS , the DSi , features two built in cameras , the ability to download games from the DSi store , and a web browser .
The PlayStation Portable , or PSP , released later the same year on 12 December 2004 , followed a different pattern .
It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format , Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) , as its primary storage media .
Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability , connectivity with the PlayStation 3 and other PSPs , and Internet connectivity .
The Nintendo DS likewise has connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser , as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles .
Despite high sales numbers for both consoles , PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS ; nevertheless , the PlayStation Portable has the distinction of being the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system .
what does it say on the doll sgt . peppers
Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( often shortened to Sgt . Pepper ) is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles .
Released in June 1967 , the album included songs such as `` With a Little Help from My Friends `` , `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds `` , and `` A Day in the Life `` .
Continuing the artistic maturation seen on the band 's album Revolver ( 1966 ) , Sgt . Pepper further departed from the conventional pop rock idiom of the time and incorporated balladry , psychedelic , music hall , and symphonic influences .
During the Sgt . Pepper sessions , the group improved upon the quality of their music 's production while exploring experimental recording techniques .
Producer George Martin 's innovative approach included the use of an orchestra .
Widely acclaimed and imitated , the album cover , designed by English pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth , was inspired by a sketch by Paul McCartney that depicted the band posing in front of a collage of some of their favourite celebrities .
Sgt . Pepper was a worldwide critical and commercial success , spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK Album Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200 .
A seminal work in the emerging psychedelic rock style , the album was critically acclaimed upon release and won four Grammy Awards in 1968 .
With an estimated 32 million copies sold , it is one of the world 's best selling albums .
Sgt . Pepper is considered by many to be the most influential and famous rock album ever , and has been named the greatest album of all time by both All Time Top 1000 Albums and Rolling Stone .
what does the temporal lobe part of the brain do
The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain .
The temporal lobes are involved in the retention of visual memories , processing sensory input , comprehending language , storing new memories , emotion , and deriving meaning .
how many lungs does a human have
The human lungs are the organs of respiration in humans .
Humans have two lungs , a right lung and a left lung .
The right lung consists of three lobes while the left lung is slightly smaller consisting of only two lobes ( the left lung has a `` cardiac notch '' allowing space for the heart within the chest ) .
Together , the lungs contain approximately of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli , having a total surface area of about ( ) in adults — roughly the same area as one side of a tennis court .
Furthermore , if all of the capillaries that surround the alveoli were unwound and laid end to end , they would extend for about .
Each lung weighs , therefore making the entire organ about .
Human lungs
The trachea divides into two bronchi ( one for each side ) at the level of T4 .
This junction is also known as the carina .
The conducting zone contains the trachea , the bronchi , the bronchioles , and the terminal bronchioles The respiratory zone contains the respiratory bronchioles , the alveolar ducts , and the alveoli .
The conducting zone and the respiratory stuffers ( but not the alveoli ) are made up of airways .
The conducting zone has no gas exchange with the blood , and is reinforced with cartilage in order to hold open the airways .
The conducting zone warms the air to and humidifies the air .
It also cleanses the air by removing particles via cilia located on the walls of all the passageways .
The lungs are surrounded by the rib cage .
The respiratory zone is the site of gas exchange with blood .
The sympathetic nervous system via noradrenaline acting on the beta receptors causes bronchodilation .
The parasympathetic nervous system via acetylcholine , which acts on the M-3 muscarinic receptors , maintains the resting tone of the bronchiolar smooth muscle .
This action is related , although considered distinct from bronchoconstriction .
Many other non-autonomic nervous and biochemical stimuli , including carbon dioxide and oxygen , are also involved in the regulation process .
The pleural cavity is the potential space between the parietal pleura , lining the inner wall of the thoracic cage , and the visceral pleura lining the lungs .
The lung parenchyma is strictly used to refer solely to alveolar tissue with respiratory bronchioles , alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioles .
However , it often includes any form of lung tissue , also including bronchioles , bronchi , blood vessels and lung interstitium .
What a Margarita contains

what causes photo red eye
Intense red-eye effect in blue eyes with dilated pupil
The red-eye effect in photography is the common appearance of red pupils in color photographs of eyes .
It occurs when using a photographic flash very close to the camera lens ( as with most compact cameras ) , in ambient low light .
The effect appears in the eyes of humans and animals that have tapetum lucidum .
Theatrical followspot operators , positioned nearly coincidentally with a very bright light and somewhat distant from the actors , occasionally witness red-eye in actors on stage .
The effect is not visible to the rest of the audience because it is reliant on the very small angle between the followspot operator and the light .

what day is the feast of st joseph 's ?
Saint Joseph with the Infant Jesus by Guido Reni
Saint Joseph 's Day , March 19 , the Feast of St. Joseph is in Western Christianity the principal feast day of Saint Joseph , Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary .
He is also the step-father of Jesus of Nazareth /Jesus Christ .
It has the rank of a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church ; Catholics who follow the Missal of 1962 celebrate it as a first class feast .
Previous to 1962 it was celebrated as a feast of the rank of double of the first class .
It is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the Anglican Communion , and a feast or festival in the Lutheran Church .
Saint Joseph 's Day is the Patronal Feast day for Poland as well as for Canada , persons named Joseph , Josephine , etc. , for religious institutes , schools and parishes bearing his name , and for carpenters .
It is also Father 's Day in some Catholic countries , mainly Spain , Portugal , and Italy .
March 19 was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the tenth century , and this custom was established in Rome by 1479 .
Pope St. Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution Quo Primum ( July 14 , 1570 ) .
Since 1969 , Episcopal Conferences may , if they wish , transfer it to a date outside Lent .
Between 1870 and 1955 , a feast was celebrated in honor of St. Joseph as Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Patron of the Universal Church , the latter title having been given to him by Pope Pius IX .
Originally celebrated on the third Sunday after Easter with an octave , after Divino Afflatu of St. Pius X ( see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X ) , it was moved to the preceding Wednesday .
The feast was also retitled The Solemnity of Saint Joseph .
This celebration and its accompanying octave was abolished during the modernisation and simplification of rubrics under Pope Pius XII in 1955 .
It is still maintained by Catholics who follow the missal of 1962 or earlier missals .
As the traditional holiday of the Apostles Ss . Philip and James , May 1 , had faded from the memory of most Catholics by the mid-twentieth century , that of Joseph the Worker was created in order to coincide with the celebration of international Labour Day ( May Day ) in many countries .
The feast of Ss . Philip and James , which had been celebrated on that date since the sixth century , was moved from its traditional place .
In the new calendar published in 1969 , the feast , which at one time occupied the highest possible rank in the Church calendar , was reduced to an optional Memorial , the lowest rank for a saint 's day .
The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Joseph on the Sunday after Christmas .

Carey left Columbia in 2000 , and signed a record-breaking $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records .
Before the release of her first feature film Glitter ( 2001 ) , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion .

what do bumble bees do
A bumblebee is any member of the bee genus Bombus , in the family Apidae .
There are over 250 known species , existing primarily in the Northern Hemisphere although they also occur in South America .
They have been introduced to New Zealand and the Australian state of Tasmania .
Bumblebees are social insects that are characterised by black and yellow body hairs , often in bands .
However , some species have orange or red on their bodies , or may be entirely black .
Another obvious ( but not unique ) characteristic is the soft nature of the hair ( long , branched setae ) , called pile , that covers their entire body , making them appear and feel fuzzy .
They are best distinguished from similarly large , fuzzy bees by the form of the female hind leg , which is modified to form a corbicula : a shiny concave surface that is bare , but surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen ( in similar bees , the hind leg is completely hairy , and pollen grains are wedged into the hairs for transport ) .
Like their relatives the honey bees , bumblebees feed on nectar and gather pollen to feed their young .
how many states have open carry gun laws
A man openly carrying a handgun in a Burger King in Eagle , Colorado .
In the United States , open carry is shorthand terminology for `` openly carrying a firearm in public '' , as distinguished from concealed carry , where firearms can not be seen by the casual observer .
The practice of open carry , where gun owners openly carry firearms while they go about their daily business , has seen an increase in the U.S. in recent years .
This has been marked by a number of organized events intended to increase the visibility of open carry and public awareness about the practice .
Proponents of open carry point to history and statistics , noting that criminals usually conceal their weapons .
Encouraged by groups like OpenCarry.org , GeorgiaCarry.org and some participants of the Free State Project , open carry has seen a revival in recent years , but it is not yet clear if this represents just a short-term trend .
The gun rights community has been mixed in its response .
Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation and the NRA have been cautious in expressing support , while special-interest groups such as the aforementioned OpenCarry.org and GeorgiaCarry.org , and certain national groups such as the Gun Owners of America ( GOA ) have been more outspoken in favor of the practice .
Open carry is strongly opposed by gun control groups such as the Brady Campaign and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence .

how was color introduced in film ?
Color motion picture film refers both to unexposed color photographic film in a format suitable for use in a motion picture camera , and to finished motion picture film , ready for use in a projector , which bears images in color .
The first color cinematography was by means of additive color systems such as the one patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902 .
A simplified additive system was developed by George Albert Smith and successfully commercialized in 1909 as Kinemacolor .
These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color filters .
Still from footage recorded by Edward Turner in 1902
With the present-day technology , there are two distinct processes : Eastman Color Negative 2 chemistry ( camera negative stocks , duplicating interpositive and internegative stocks ) and Eastman Color Positive 2 chemistry ( positive prints for direct projection ) , usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2 .
Fuji 's products are compatible with ECN-2 and ECP-2 .

what came first army or air force
The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the military aviation arm of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force .
The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which in 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the AAF .
Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army .
The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Army Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and ground forces corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel .
In practice , the AAF was virtually autonomous inside the Army .
The peak size of the AAF was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft in 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 .
By VE Day it had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide .
The Air Corps became the Army Air Forces in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , and to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force .
Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of the army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the United States Army until the United States Air Force came into being in September 1947 .
However , in its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization .
By the end of World War II the AAF had become virtually an independent service .
By regulation and executive order , the AAF was a subordinate agency of the War Department tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , limited in responsibility to the continental United States , as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces .
In reality , Headquarters AAF controlled the conduct of all aspects of the air war in every part of the world , determining air policy and issuing orders without transmitting them through the Chief of Staff .
This `` contrast between theory and fact is ... fundamental to an understanding of the AAF . ''
what does the FOIA apply to
The Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) is a federal freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the United States government .
The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure , outlines mandatory disclosure procedures and grants nine exemptions to the statute .

what cards do you need in poker to get a royal flush
In poker , players construct hands of five cards according to predetermined rules , which vary according to which variant of poker is being played .
These hands are compared using a hand ranking system that is standard across all variants of poker , the player with the highest-ranking hand winning that particular deal in most variants of poker .
In some variants , the lowest-ranking hand can win or tie .
These hand rankings are also used in some other card games , and in poker dice .
The ranking of a particular hand is increased by including multiple cards of the same card rank , by all five cards being from the same suit , or by all five cards being of consecutive rank .
The relative ranking of the various hand categories is based on the probability of being randomly dealt such a hand from a well- shuffled deck .

what kind of citrus comes from cuba
Sugarcane plantation in rural Cuba
Agriculture in Cuba has played an important part in the economy for several hundred years .
Agriculture contributes less than 10 percent to the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , but it employs roughly 20 percent of the working population .
About 30 percent of the country 's land is used for crop cultivation .
The inefficient agricultural industry in Cuba has led to the need to import large amounts of foods .
Cuba now imports about 80 % of the food it rations to the public .
The rationing program accounts for about a third of the food energy the average Cuban consumes .
Overall , however , Cuba is dependent on imports for only 16 % of its food .
how many states are involved in the mega million drawing
right
Mega Millions ( initially called The Big Game Mega Millions as the successor of The Big Game ) is an American multi-jurisdictional $ 1 lottery game .
The first ( The Big Game ) Mega Millions drawing was in 2002 ( see below ) .
The minimum Mega Millions advertised jackpot is $ 12,000,000 , paid in 26 equal yearly installments ( unless the cash option is chosen ) ; usually , the jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner .
However , despite no jackpot winner for the $ 12,000,000 December 18 , 2012 drawing , the jackpot remained at $ 12,000,000 for the drawing to be held on December 21 .
( See below for information on how the game 's jackpot is funded . )
Reflecting common practice among American lotteries , the jackpot is advertised as a nominal value of annual installments .
A cash value option ( the usual choice ) , when chosen by a jackpot winner ( see below ) , pays the approximate present value of the installments .
Mega Millions currently uses a 5/56 ( white balls ) plus 1/46 ( the Mega Ball ) double matrix to select its winning numbers .
Each game costs $ 1 .
In 43 of the 44 Mega Millions jurisdictions ( California is the exception ) , there is an option , called Megaplier ( such games are $ 2 each ) where non-jackpot prizes are multiplied by 2 , 3 , or 4 .
The Megaplier was made available to all Mega Millions jurisdictions in January 2011 ; it began as a Texas -only option .
Mega Millions is drawn at 10:59 p.m. Eastern time Tuesdays and Fridays , including holidays .
Mega Millions is administered by a consortium of its 12 original lotteries and the drawings are held at WSB-TV in Atlanta , Georgia .
supervised by the Georgia Lottery .
The largest jackpot in Mega Millions , as well as in American lottery history , was $ 656,000,000 annuitized ( with a cash option of $ 474,000,000 ) for the March 30 , 2012 drawing in which there were three jackpot-winning tickets ; one each in Illinois , Kansas , and Maryland .
All three tickets had been claimed as of April 18 , with each set of winners choosing the cash option .

what does japan call their halloween
Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of `` All Hallows ' Evening `` ) , also known as All Hallows ' Eve , is a yearly celebration observed in a number of countries on October 31 , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ( or All Saints ) and the day initiating the triduum of Hallowmas .
According to many scholars , All Hallows ' Eve is a Christianised feast originally influenced by western European harvest festivals , and festivals of the dead with possible pagan roots , particularly the Celtic Samhain .
Other scholars maintain that it originated independently of Samhain and has solely Christian roots .
Typical festive Halloween activities include trick-or-treating ( also known as `` guising `` ) , attending costume parties , carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns , lighting bonfires , apple bobbing , visiting haunted attractions , playing pranks , telling scary stories , and watching horror films .

how many countries do not allow women to vote
U.S. women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote , February 1913 .
Women 's suffrage also known as woman suffrage is the right of women to vote and to run for office .
Limited voting rights were gained by women in Sweden , Finland and some western U.S. states in the late 19th century .
International organizations were formed to coordinate efforts , especially the International Council of Women ( 1888 ) and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance ( 1904 ) .
In 1893 , New Zealand , then a self-governing British colony , granted adult women the right to vote and the self-governing British colony of South Australia did the same in 1895 , but also permitted women to run for office .
Australia federated in 1901 , and women acquired the right to vote and stand in federal elections from 1902 , though uneven restrictions on Aboriginal women voting in national elections were not completely removed until 1962 .
The first European country to introduce women 's suffrage was the Grand Duchy of Finland , then part of the Russian Empire , which also produced the world 's first female members of parliament in the 1907 parliamentary elections .
Norway followed , granting full women 's suffrage in 1913 .
In most Western countries , women 's suffrage came after World I War I I , with some important late adopters being France in 1944 and Switzerland in 1971 .
Women 's suffrage has generally been recognized after political campaigns to obtain it were waged .
In many countries it was granted before universal suffrage .
Women 's suffrage is explicitly stated as a right under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , adopted by the United Nations in 1979 .

what do jehovah witnesses believe
Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity .Sources for descriptors : • Millenarian : • Restorationist : • Christian : • Denomination : The organization reports worldwide membership of over 7.78 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance of over 12 million , and annual Memorial attendance of over 19 million .
They are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , that establishes all doctrines .
Jehovah 's Witnesses ' beliefs are based on their interpretations of the Bible and they prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom on earth is the only solution for all problems faced by mankind .
The group emerged from the Bible Student movement —founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell with the formation of Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society —with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford .
The name Jehovah 's witnesses , based on Isaiah 43:10–12 , was adopted in 1931 to distinguish themselves from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions .
Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake !
, and refusing military service and blood transfusions .
They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship .
They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines .
They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays , or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity .
Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as `` the truth '' and consider themselves to be `` in the truth '' .
They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses .
Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning .
Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned .
Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant .
The religion 's position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute national flags has brought it into conflict with some governments .
Consequently , Jehovah 's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries .
Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah 's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries .

how old old is xp operating system
Windows XP is an operating system produced by Microsoft for use on personal computers , including home and business desktops , laptops and media centers .
First released to computer manufacturers on August 24 , 2001 , it is the second most popular version of Windows , based on installed user base .
The name `` XP '' is short for `` eXPerience '' , highlighting the enhanced user experience .
Windows XP , the successor to Windows 2000 and Windows ME , was the first consumer-oriented operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the Windows NT kernel .
Windows XP was released worldwide for retail sale on October 25 , 2001 , and over 400 million copies were in use in January 2006 .
It was succeeded by Windows Vista in January 2007 .
Direct OEM and retail sales of Windows XP ceased on June 30 , 2008 .
Microsoft continued to sell Windows XP through their System Builders ( smaller OEMs who sell assembled computers ) program until January 31 , 2009 .
On April 10 , 2012 , Microsoft reaffirmed that extended support for Windows XP and Office 2003 would end on April 8 , 2014 and suggested that administrators begin preparing to migrate to a newer OS .
The NT -based versions of Windows , which are programmed in C , C++ , and assembly , are known for their improved stability and efficiency over the 9x versions of Microsoft Windows .
Windows XP presented a significantly redesigned graphical user interface , a change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than previous versions of Windows .
In an attempt to further ameliorate the `` DLL hell `` that plagued the past versions of Windows , improved side-by-side assembly technology in Windows XP allows side-by-side installation , registration and servicing of multiple versions of globally shared software components in full isolation .
It is also the first version of Windows to use product activation to combat illegal copying .
During Windows XP 's development , the project was codenamed `` Whistler '' , after Whistler , British Columbia , as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort .
According to web analytics data generated by Net Applications , Windows XP was the most widely used operating system until August 2012 , when Windows 7 overtook it .
, Windows XP market share is at 38.99 % , having decreased almost every month since at least November 2007 , the first month for which statistics are publicly available from Net Applications .

what happens when the baroreceptor reflex is activated
The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body 's homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure .
It provides a negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes heart rate to decrease therefore causing blood pressure to decrease ; likewise , decreased blood pressure activates the baroreflex , causing heart rate to increase thus causing an increase in blood pressure .
The system relies on specialized neurons , known as baroreceptors , in the aortic arch , carotid sinuses , and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the brainstem .
Subsequent changes in blood pressure are mediated by the autonomic nervous system .
Atrial natriuretic peptide forms a parallel negative feedback loop in an endocrinological contrast to the renin-angiotensin system .
what ever happened to the survivors of the 1989 california earthquake
The Loma Prieta earthquake , also known as the Quake of '89 and the World Series Earthquake , was a major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area of California on October 17 , 1989 , at 5:04 pm local time .
Caused by a slip along the San Andreas Fault , the quake lasted 10–15 seconds and measured 6.9 on both the moment magnitude scale ( surface-wave magnitude 7.1 ) and on the open-ended Richter Scale .
The quake killed 63 people throughout northern California , injured 3,757 and left some 3,000–12,000 people homeless .
The earthquake occurred during the warm-up practice for the third game of the 1989 World Series , featuring both of the Bay Area 's Major League Baseball teams , the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants .
Because of game-related sports coverage , this was the first major earthquake in the United States to have its initial jolt broadcast live on television .
how many pawns in chess
Pawn in the standard Staunton pattern
The pawn ( ♙♟ ) is the most numerous and in most circumstances the weakest piece in the game of chess , historically representing infantry or , more particularly , armed peasants or pikemen .
In chess , each player begins the game with eight pawns , one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces .
( In algebraic notation , the white pawns start on a2 , b2 , c2 , ... , h2 , while black pawns start on a7 , b7 , c7 , ... , h7 . )
Individual pawns are referred to by the file on which they stand .
For example , one speaks of `` White 's f-pawn '' or `` Black 's b-pawn '' , or less commonly ( using descriptive notation ) , `` White 's king 's bishop pawn '' or `` Black 's queen 's knight pawn '' .
It is also common to refer to a rook pawn , meaning any pawn on the a- or h-file , a knight pawn ( on the b- or g-file ) , a bishop pawn ( on the c- or f-file ) , a queen pawn ( on the d-file ) , a king pawn ( on the e-file ) , and a central pawn ( on either the d- or e-file ) .

how is hydrogen produced
Hydrogen production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen .
Currently the dominant technology for direct production is steam reforming from hydrocarbons .
Many other methods are known including electrolysis and thermolysis .
In 2006 , the United States was estimated to have a production capacity of 11 million tonnes of hydrogen .
5 million tonnes of hydrogen were consumed on-site in oil refining , and in the production of ammonia ( Haber process ) and methanol ( reduction of carbon monoxide ) .
0.4 million tonnes were an incidental by-product of the chlor-alkali process .
Hydrogen production is an estimated $ 100 billion industry .
how many percent is a basis point
A basis point ( often denoted as bp , colloquially referred to in the plural as `` bips '' , also known as a `` beep '' ) is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point , or one part per ten thousand , 1/10000 .
The same unit is also ( rarely ) called a permyriad , literally meaning 'for ( every ) myriad ( ten thousand ) ' , and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign ( % ) with two extra zeroes at the end ( like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator , although it originates as a natural extension of the percent ( % ) and permille ( ‰ ) signs ) .
A basis point is defined as:
1 basis point = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent
1 bp = 1 = 0.01 % = 0.1‰ = 10−4 = = 0.0001
1 % = 100 bp = 100
Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1 % are discussed .
The most common example is interest rates , where differences in interest rates of less than 1 % per year are usually meaningful to talk about .
For example , a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points ( e.g . a 4.67 % rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77 % ) .
Like percentage points , basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate .
For example , if a report says there has been a `` 1 % increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , this could refer to an increase either from 10 % to 10.1 % ( relative , 1 % of 10 % ) , or from 10 % to 11 % ( absolute , 1 % plus 10 % ) .
If , however , the report says there has been a `` 10 basis point increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , then we know that the interest rate of 10 % has increased by 0.10 % ( the absolute change ) to a 10.1 % rate .
It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument , or the difference ( spread ) between two interest rates , including the yields of fixed-income securities .
Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security , they will often be quoted as a spread over ( or under ) the index .
For example , a loan that bears interest of 0.50 % per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR , which is commonly expressed as `` L+50bps '' or simply `` L+50 '' .
The term `` basis point '' has its origins in trading the `` basis '' or the spread between two interest rates .
Since the basis is usually small , these are quoted multiplied up by 10000 , and hence a `` full point '' movement in the `` basis '' is a basis point .
Contrast with pips in FX forward markets .
The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows : 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points , and 0.01 percentage points = 1 basis point .
So , a bond whose yield increases from 5 % to 5.5 % is said to increase by 50 basis points ; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points .
what does the royal family do
The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom .
The term is also commonly applied to the same group of people who are the relations of the monarch in her or his role as sovereign of any of the other Commonwealth realms , thus sometimes at variance with official national terms for the family .
Members of the Royal Family belong to , either by birth or marriage , the House of Windsor , since 1917 , when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha .
This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family 's strong German ancestry ; it was felt that its public image could be improved by choosing a more British house name .
The new name chosen , Windsor , had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence .
Although in the United Kingdom there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family , and different lists will include different people , those carrying the style Her or His Majesty ( HM ) , or Her or His Royal Highness ( HRH ) are always considered members , which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch , the consort of the monarch , the widowed consorts of previous monarchs , the children of the monarch and previous monarchs , the male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs , and the spouses and the widows of a monarch 's and previous monarch 's sons and male-line grandsons .
On 30 November 1917 , King George V issued Letters Patent defining who are members of the Royal Family ; the text of the notice from the London Gazette is as follows:
In 1996 , Her Majesty The Queen modified these Letters Patent , as was evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette:
In 2013 Letters Patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the Royal Family to additional persons to be born , evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette:
Members and relatives of the British Royal Family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the British Empire , sometimes for extended periods as viceroys , or for specific ceremonies or events .
Today , they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom .
Aside from the monarch , their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve , if eligible and when appointed by letters patent , as a Counsellor of State , two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown ( within stipulated limits ) in the indisposal or absence from the British realm of the monarch .
In the other realms of the Commonwealth royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State .
However in each such realm the monarch 's family members may act on behalf of , are funded by , and represent the sovereign of that particular state , and not the United Kingdom .
The Queen , her consort , her children and grandchildren , as well as all former sovereigns ' children and grandchildren hold places in the first sections of the official orders of precedence in England and Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland .
Wives of the said enjoy their husbands ' precedence , and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well .
However , the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the Royal Family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra , who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall , who is otherwise the realm 's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself .
She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses , such as the daughters of her younger sons .
what countries are very near to Haiti ?
Haiti ( ; Haitian Creole Ayiti ) , officially the Republic of Haiti ( ; ) , is a Caribbean country .
It occupies the western , smaller portion of the island of Hispaniola , in the Greater Antillean archipelago , which it shares with the Dominican Republic .
Ayiti ( land of high mountains ) was the indigenous Taíno or Amerindian name for the island .
The country 's highest point is Pic la Selle , at .
The total area of Haiti is and its capital is Port-au-Prince .
Haitian Creole and French are the official languages .
Haiti 's regional , historical , and ethno-linguistic position is unique for several reasons .
It was the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the first black -led republic in the world , and the second republic in the Americas when it gained independence in 1804 as part of a successful slave revolution lasting nearly a decade .
In 2012 , Haiti announced its intention to seek associate membership status in the African Union .
Haiti is the most populous of the predominantly Francophone independent nations in the Americas .
It is one of only two independent nations in the Americas ( along with Canada ) to designate French as an official language ; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements , or collectivités , of France .
Haiti is the most populous full member-state of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) .
It is the poorest country in the Americas as measured by the Human Development Index .
Political violence has occurred regularly throughout its history , leading to government instability .
Most recently , in February 2004 , a coup d'état originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ( MINUSTAH ) .
Michel Martelly , the current president , was elected in the Haitian general election , 2011 .
The island has had a history of destructive earthquakes .
A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 and devastated Port-au-Prince .
The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000 .
Haitian government estimates were higher .
The Presidential palace , Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed , along with countless homes and businesses , leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless .
The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake ( and subsequent incidents ) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010 , as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake .
United States aid organizations have donated $ 2 billion .
Combined with other international donations , these funds are intended to contribute to the rebuilding of the country .

how is a telephone pagers made
A Motorola Advisor alphanumeric pager used in Brazil in the 1990s , operated by Teletrim
A pager is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays numeric or text messages , or receives and announces voice messages .
One-way pagers can only receive messages , while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge , reply to , and originate messages using an internal transmitter .
Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters ( or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers , one or more base stations ) , as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users .
These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter , to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations .
One of the first practical paging services was launched in 1950 for physicians in the New York City area .
Physicians paid US $ 12 per month for the service and carried a ( 6 oz ) pager that would receive phone messages within ( 25 mi ) of a single transmitter tower .
The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company and operated by Telanswerphone .
In 1960 , John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola 's Walkie Talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the first transistorized pager , and from this point , paging technology continued to advance , and pager adoption continued to expand , until the early 1990s .
However , by the mid-1990s , as cellular technologies became cheaper and more widely available , advanced services began to displace paging as a commercial product .
Today , pagers exist largely as niche products , finding preferential use in applications such as hospitals , public safety , and retail locations where their simplicity , high reliability , and low cost represent significant advantages .

How did Frida Kahlo die ?
Frida Kahlo de Rivera ( born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón ; July 6 , 1907 – July 13 , 1954 ) was a Mexican painter , born in Coyoacán , who is best known for her self-portraits .
Kahlo 's life began and ended in Mexico City , in her home known as the Blue House .
She gave her birth date as July 7 , 1910 , but her birth certificate shows July 6 , 1907 .
Kahlo had allegedly wanted the year of her birth to coincide with the year of the beginning of the Mexican revolution so that her life would begin with the birth of modern Mexico .
Her work has been celebrated in Mexico as emblematic of national and indigenous tradition , and by feminists for its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form .
Mexican culture and Amerindian cultural tradition are important in her work , which has been sometimes characterized as Naïve art or folk art .
Her work has also been described as `` surrealist '' , and in 1938 André Breton , principal initiator of the surrealist movement , described Kahlo 's art as a `` ribbon around a bomb '' .
Kahlo had a volatile marriage with the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera .
She suffered lifelong health problems .
Many of her health problems were the result of a traffic accident she survived as a teenager .
Recovering from her injuries isolated her from other people and this isolation influenced her works , many of which are self-portraits of one sort or another .
Kahlo suggested , `` I paint myself because I am so often alone and because I am the subject I know best . ''
She also stated , `` I was born a bitch .
I was born a painter . ''

Theresienwiese on the day before Oktoberfest 2006
Oktoberfest is a 16-day festival celebrating beer held annually in Munich , Bavaria , Germany , running from late September to the first weekend in October .
It is one of the most famous events in Germany and is the world 's largest fair , with more than 6 million people from around the world attending the event every year .
To the locals , it is not called Oktoberfest , but `` die Wiesn '' , after the colloquial name of the fairgrounds themselves .
The Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture , having been held since 1810 .
Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations , modeled after the original Munich event .
The Munich Oktoberfest originally took place during the sixteen days up to , and including , the first Sunday in October .
In 1994 , the schedule was modified in response to German reunification so that if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or 2nd , then the festival would go on until October 3 ( German Unity Day ) .
Thus , the festival is now 17 days when the first Sunday is October 2 and 18 days when it is October 1 .
In 2010 , the festival lasted until the first Monday in October , to mark the anniversary of the event .
The festival is held in an area named the Theresienwiese ( field , or meadow , of Therese ) , often called Wiesn for short , located near Munich 's center .
Large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed , with almost 7 million liters served during the 16 day festival in 2007 .
Visitors may also enjoy a wide variety of traditional food such as Hendl ( chicken ) , Schweinebraten ( roast pork ) , Schweinshaxe ( grilled ham hock ) , Steckerlfisch ( grilled fish on a stick ) , Würstl ( sausages ) along with Brezeln ( Pretzel ) , Knödel ( potato or bread dumplings ) , Käsespätzle ( cheese noodles ) , Reiberdatschi ( potato pancakes ) , Sauerkraut or Rotkohl/Blaukraut ( red cabbage ) along with such Bavarian delicacies as Obatzda ( a spiced cheese-butter spread ) and Weisswurst ( a white sausage ) .
how does milk turn into different types of cheeses
A platter with cheese and garnishes
Wheels of Gouda
Cheese is a generic term for a diverse group of milk-based food products .
Cheese is produced in wide-ranging flavors , textures , and forms .
Cheese consists of proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep .
It is produced by coagulation of the milk protein casein .
Typically , the milk is acidified and addition of the enzyme rennet causes coagulation .
The solids are separated and pressed into final form .
Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout .
Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature .
Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced .
Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and aging .
Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents .
The yellow to red color of many cheeses , such as Red Leicester , is normally formed from adding annatto .
For a few cheeses , the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice .
Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria , which turn milk sugars into lactic acid , then the addition of rennet completes the curdling .
Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available ; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei , but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family .
Cheese is valued for its portability , long life , and high content of fat , protein , calcium , and phosphorus .
Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk , although how long a cheese will keep may depend on the type of cheese ; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening .
Generally speaking , hard cheeses last longer than soft cheeses , such as Brie or goat 's milk cheese .
Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher , lower-priced milk , and lower shipping costs .
The long storage life of some cheese , especially if it is encased in a protective rind , allows selling when markets are favorable .
Additional ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black peppers , garlic , chives or cranberries .
A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger .
To become an expert in this field , like wine or cooking , requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience .
This position is typically responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory ; selecting the cheese menu , purchasing , receiving , storage , and ripening .
what does cf mean in legal citation ?
Legal citation signals are a set of brief abbreviated phrases or words used to clarify the authority or significance of a legal citation as it relates to a proposition .
Signals help a reader quickly discern meaning or usefulness of a particular reference when the reference itself does not provide adequate information .
Most citation signals are placed in front of the citation to which they apply .
For example , in the paragraph When writing a legal argument , it is important to refer to primary sources .
To assist readers in locating these sources , it is desirable to use a standardized citation format .
See generally Harvard Law Review Association , The Bluebook : A Uniform System of Citation ( 18th ed . 2005 ) .
Note , however , that some courts may require any legal papers that are submitted to them to conform to a different citation format .
the signal is the phrase `` see generally , '' which indicates that the citation `` The Bluebook : A Uniform System of Citation ( 18th ed . 2005 ) '' provides general background information on the topic .

What causes rogue waves
The Draupner wave , a single giant wave measured on New Year 's Day 1995 , finally confirmed the existence of freak waves , which had previously been considered near-mythical
Rogue waves ( also known as freak waves , monster waves , killer waves , extreme waves , and abnormal waves ) are relatively large and spontaneous ocean surface waves that occur far out at sea , and are a threat even to large ships and ocean liners .
In oceanography , they are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height ( SWH ) , which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record .
Therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea ; they are , rather , surprisingly large waves for a given sea state .
Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause , but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave .
how does british succession work
Electress Sophia of Hanover ( 1630–1714 )
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms .
The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics .
The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed , but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line .
At a summit in Perth , Western Australia in 2011 , the heads of government of all 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to adopt absolute primogeniture , end the exclusion of people married to Roman Catholics , and make other changes in the succession rules .
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State ( and a regent if the need arises ) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937 .
For earlier versions of the line of succession , see History of the British line of succession .

what factors stand out in the war against terror articles
The War on Terror ( also known as the Global War on Terrorism ) is a term commonly applied to an international military campaign which started as a result of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States .
This resulted in an international military campaign to eliminate al-Qaeda and other militant organizations .
The United Kingdom and many other NATO and non-NATO nations participate in the conflict .
The phrase 'War on Terror ' was first used by US President George W. Bush on 20 September 2001 .
The Bush administration and the Western media have since used the term to signify a global military , political , lawful , and conceptual struggle—targeting both organizations designated as terrorist and regimes accused of supporting them .
It was typically used with a particular focus on militant Islamists , al-Qaeda , and other jihadi groups .
Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President Barack Obama ( which instead uses the term Overseas Contingency Operation ) , it is still commonly used by politicians , in the media and by some aspects of government officially , such as the United States ' Global War on Terrorism Service Medal .
what caused the world war 2
German battleship Schleswig-Holstein , Westerplatte , September 1 , 1939
Destroyer USS Shaw exploding after her forward magazine was detonated during the Attack on Pearl Harbor
The main causes of World War II were nationalistic issues , unresolved issues , and resentments resulting from World War I and the interwar period in Europe , in addition to the effects of the Great Depression in the 1930s .
The culmination of events that led to the outbreak of war are generally understood to be the 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany and Soviet Russia and the 1937 invasion of the Republic of China by the Empire of Japan .
These military aggressions were the result of decisions made by the authoritarian ruling Nazi elite in Germany and by the leadership of the Kwantung Army in Japan .
World War II started after these aggressive actions were met with an official declaration of war and/or armed resistance .

what contributes to high blood pressure
Blood pressure ( BP ) , sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure , is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels , and is one of the principal vital signs .
When used without further specification , `` blood pressure '' usually refers to the arterial pressure of the systemic circulation .
During each heartbeat , blood pressure varies between a maximum ( systolic ) and a minimum ( diastolic ) pressure .
The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart .
Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation .
The rate of mean blood flow depends on the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels .
Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy .
Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation , although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles .
Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces ( e.g. , during standing ) and valves in veins , breathing , and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins .
Blood pressure without further specification usually refers to the systemic arterial pressure measured at a person 's upper arm and is a measure of the pressure in the brachial artery , the major artery in the upper arm .
A person’s blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimetres of mercury ( mmHg ) , for example 120/80 .
how many votes needed before governor can not veto
A veto – Latin for `` I forbid '' – is the power ( used by an officer of the state , for example ) to unilaterally stop an official action , especially the enactment of legislation .
A veto can be absolute , as for instance in the United Nations Security Council , whose permanent members ( China , France , Russia , United Kingdom , United States of America ) can block any resolution .
Or it can be limited , as in the legislative process of the United States , where a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate may override a Presidential veto of legislation .
A veto only gives power to stop changes , not to adopt them ( except for the rare `` amendatory veto '' ) .
Thus a veto allows its holder to protect the status quo .
The concept of a veto body originated with the Roman consuls and tribunes .
Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other ; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate .
how much sulfur dioxide is in propane
Sulfur dioxide ( also sulphur dioxide ) is the chemical compound with the formula .
It is a toxic gas with a pungent , irritating smell , that is released by volcanoes and in various industrial processes .
Since coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds , their combustion generates sulfur dioxide unless the sulfur compounds are removed before burning the fuel .
Further oxidation of SO2 , usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2 , forms H2SO4 , and thus acid rain .
Sulfur dioxide emissions are also a precursor to particulates in the atmosphere .
Both of these impacts are cause for concern over the environmental impact of these fuels .
how many people die from myasthenia gravis per year
Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek μύς `` muscle '' , `` weakness '' , and `` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability .
It is an autoimmune disorder , in which weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors throughout neuromuscular junctions .
Myasthenia is treated medically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy .
The disease incidence is 3–30 cases per million per year and rising as a result of increased awareness .
MG must be distinguished from congenital myasthenic syndromes that can present similar symptoms but offer no response to immunosuppressive treatments .
How LCD Monitors Work
Reflective twisted nematic liquid crystal display .
Polarizing filter film with a vertical axis to polarize light as it enters .
Glass substrate with ITO electrodes .
The shapes of these electrodes will determine the shapes that will appear when the LCD is turned ON .
Vertical ridges etched on the surface are smooth .
Twisted nematic liquid crystal .
Glass substrate with common electrode film ( ITO ) with horizontal ridges to line up with the horizontal filter .
Polarizing filter film with a horizontal axis to block/pass light .
Reflective surface to send light back to viewer .
( In a backlit LCD , this layer is replaced with a light source . )
A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a flat panel display , electronic visual display , or video display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals .
Liquid crystals do not emit light directly .
LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or fixed images which can be displayed or hidden , such as preset words , digits , and 7-segment displays as in a digital clock .
They use the same basic technology , except that arbitrary images are made up of a large number of small pixels , while other displays have larger elements .
LCDs are used in a wide range of applications including computer monitors , televisions , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and signage .
They are common in consumer devices such as video players , gaming devices , clocks , watches , calculators , and telephones , and have replaced cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in most applications .
They are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays , and since they do not use phosphors , they do not suffer image burn-in .
LCDs are , however , susceptible to image persistence .
The LCD screen is more energy efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT .
Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery -powered electronic equipment .
It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of segments filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source ( backlight ) or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome .
Liquid crystals were first discovered in 1888 .
By 2008 , worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded annual sales of CRT units ; the CRT became obsolete for most purposes .

how many classes of vitamins
A bottle of high potency B-complex vitamin supplement pills .
A vitamin ( or ) is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts .
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from the diet .
Thus , the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism .
For example , ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans , but not for most other animals , and biotin and vitamin D are required in the human diet only in certain circumstances .
By convention , the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients , such as dietary minerals , essential fatty acids , or essential amino acids ( which are needed in larger amounts than vitamins ) nor the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less often .
Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present .
Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity , not their structure .
Thus , each `` vitamin '' refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin .
Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin `` generic descriptor '' title , such as `` vitamin A `` , which includes the compounds retinal , retinol , and four known carotenoids .
Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body , and are sometimes inter-convertible to one another , as well .
Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions .
Some have hormone-like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D ) , or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation ( such as some forms of vitamin A ) .
Others function as antioxidants ( e.g. , vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C ) .
The largest number of vitamins ( such as B complex vitamins ) function as precursors for enzyme cofactors , that help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism .
In this role , vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups : For example , biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids .
Vitamins may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes , detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules .
For example , folic acid may carry methyl , formyl , and methylene groups in the cell .
Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins ' best-known function , the other vitamin functions are equally important .
Until the mid-1930s , when the first commercial yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold , vitamins were obtained solely through food intake , and changes in diet ( which , for example , could occur during a particular growing season ) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested .
However , vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives , since the middle of the 20th century .

what country is dubai in
Dubai ( ; ' , ) is a city in the United Arab Emirates , located within the emirate of the same name .
The emirate of Dubai is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf on the Arabian Peninsula and is one of the seven emirates that make up the country .
It has the largest population in the UAE ( 2,106,177 ) and the second-largest land territory by area ( 4,114 km2 ) after Abu Dhabi .
Dubai and Abu Dhabi , the national capital , are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's legislature .
The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads up the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area .
Dubai is nowadays often misperceived as a country or city-state and , in some cases , the UAE as a whole has been described as 'Dubai ' .
The earliest mention of Dubai is in 1095 AD , and the earliest recorded settlement in the region dates from 1799 .
The Sheikhdom of Dubai was formally established in 1833 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Butti Al-Maktoum when he persuaded around 800 members of his tribe of the Bani Yas , living in what was then the Second Saudi State and now part of Saudi Arabia , to follow him to the Dubai Creek by the Abu Falasa clan of the Bani Yas .
It remained under the tribe 's control when the United Kingdom assumed protection of the Sheikhdom in 1892 and joined the nascent United Arab Emirates upon independence in 1971 as the country 's second emirate .
Its strategic geographic location made the town an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century , Dubai was already an important regional port .
Today , Dubai has emerged as a cosmopolitan metropolis that has grown steadily to become a global city and a business and cultural hub of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf region .
Although Dubai 's economy was historically built on the oil industry , the emirate 's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism , real estate , and financial services .
Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events .
The city has become symbolic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings , such as the world 's tallest Burj Khalifa , in addition to ambitious development projects including man-made islands , hotels , and some of the largest shopping malls in the region and the world .
This increased attention has also highlighted labor and human rights issues concerning the city 's largely South Asian paid workforce .
Dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008–2009 as a result of the worldwide economic downturn following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 .
However , Dubai has made a steady and gradual recovery with help coming from neighboring emirates .
The handful of new projects that are in the pipeline have been able to help Dubai real estate make a comeback .
As of 2012 , Dubai is the 22nd most expensive city in the world , and the most expensive city in the Middle East , surpassing Israel 's Tel Aviv ( 31st ) .
Dubai has also been rated as one of the best places to live in the Middle East , including by US American global consulting firm Mercer who rated the city as the best place to live in the Middle East in 2011 .

how much of earth is covered ocean water
Surface of the Atlantic ocean meeting the Earth 's planetary boundary layer and troposphere .
Waves on an ocean coast .
This animation uses Earth science data from a variety of sensors on NASA Earth observing satellites to measure physical oceanography parameters such as ocean currents , ocean winds , sea surface height and sea surface temperature .
An ocean ( ; the World Ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's hydrosphere .
In the context of Earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's World Ocean – they are , in descending order of area , the Pacific , Atlantic , Indian , Southern ( Antarctic ) , and Arctic Oceans .
The word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water ( possibly a division of the World Ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land .
Earth is the only planet known to have an ocean ( or any large amounts of open liquid water ) .
Approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the Earth 's surface .
In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the Earth 's water .
Oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored .
Because it is the principal component of Earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns .
The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an average depth of .
It is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist .
The origin of Earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life .
Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .
The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System .
Early in their geologic histories , Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans .
The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water , though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus .
Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .
Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth .
The Solar System 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .
Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .
Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid .
how did elvis presley contribute to the popularity of rock and roll ?
Elvis Aaron Presley ( January 8 , 1935 – August 16 , 1977 ) was an American singer and actor .
A cultural icon , he is commonly known by the single name Elvis .
One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century , he is often referred to as the `` King of Rock and Roll '' or `` the King '' .
Born in Tupelo , Mississippi , Presley moved to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family at the age of 13 .
He began his career there in 1954 , working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience .
Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat -driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues .
RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who went on to manage the singer for over two decades .
Presley 's first RCA single , `` Heartbreak Hotel `` , released in January 1956 , was a number-one hit .
He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records .
His energized interpretations of songs , many from African-American sources , and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and controversial .
In November 1956 , he made his film debut in Love Me Tender .
Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work .
He staged few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided .
In 1968 , after seven years away from the stage , he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours .
In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite , Aloha from Hawaii .
Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health , and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42 .
Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture .
He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres , including country , pop ballads , gospel , and blues .
He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music .
Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys , he won three , and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36 .
He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame .
how is root beer made ?
A glass of root beer with foam
Root beer is a carbonated , sweetened beverage , originally made using the root of a sassafras plant ( or the bark of a sassafras tree ) as the primary flavor .
Root beer , popularized in North America , comes in two forms : alcoholic and soft drink .
The historical root beer was analogous to small beer in that the process provided a drink with a very low alcohol content .
Although roots are used as the source of many soft drinks throughout the world , often different names are used .
how does uv light activated fluorescence
Fluorescent minerals emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light
Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation .
It is a form of luminescence .
In most cases , the emitted light has a longer wavelength , and therefore lower energy , than the absorbed radiation .
However , when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense , it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons ; this two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation .
The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation , termed `` resonance fluorescence '' .
The most striking examples of fluorescence occur when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum , and thus invisible to the human eye , and the emitted light is in the visible region .
Fluorescence has many practical applications , including mineralogy , gemology , chemical sensors ( fluorescence spectroscopy ) , fluorescent labelling , dyes , biological detectors , and , most commonly , fluorescent lamps .
what does informal logic mean
Informal logic , intuitively , refers to the principles of logic and logical thought outside of a formal setting .
However , perhaps because of the informal in the title , the precise definition of informal logic is a matter of some dispute .
Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair define informal logic as `` a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards , criteria , procedures for the analysis , interpretation , evaluation , criticism and construction of argumentation . ''
This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts .
Informal logic is associated with ( informal ) fallacies , critical thinking , the Thinking Skills Movement and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as argumentation theory .
Frans H. van Eemeren writes that the label `` informal logic '' covers a `` collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of argumentation than formal logic . ''
what brought about the great depression
USA annual real GDP 1910–60 , with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted .
Unemployment rate in the US 1910–1960 , with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted .
The Great Depression began in August of 1929 , when the United States economy first went into an economic recession .
Although the country spent two months with declining GDP , it was not until the Wall Street Crash of October , 1929 that the effects of a declining economy were felt , and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued .
The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment , poverty , low profits , deflation , plunging farm incomes , and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement .
Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial , the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future .
The usual explanations include numerous factors , especially high consumer debt , ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors , and the lack of high-growth new industries , all interacting to create a downward economic spiral of reduced spending , falling confidence , and lowered production .
Industries that suffered the most included construction , agriculture as dust-bowl conditions persisted in the agricultural heartland , shipping , mining , and logging as well as durable goods like automobiles and appliances that could be postponed .
The economy reached bottom in the winter of 1932–33 ; then came four years of very rapid growth until 1937 , when the Recession of 1937 brought back 1934 levels of unemployment .
The Depression caused major political changes in America .
Three years into the depression , Herbert Hoover lost the 1932 presidential election to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a sweeping landslide .
Roosevelt 's economic recovery plan , the New Deal , instituted unprecedented programs for relief , recovery and reform , and brought about a major realignment of American politics .
The Depression also resulted in an increase of emigration of people to other countries for the first time in American history .
For example , some immigrants went back to their native countries , and some native US citizens went to Canada , Australia , and South Africa .
It also resulted in the mass migration of people from badly hit areas in the Great Plains and the South to places such as California and the North , respectively ( see Okies and the Great Migration of African Americans ) .
Racial tensions also increased during this time .
By the 1940s immigration had returned back to normal , and emigration declined .
A well-known example of an emigrant was Frank McCourt , who went to Ireland , as recounted in his book Angela 's Ashes .
The memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns , such as the use of stimulus packages , Keynesian economics , and Social Security .
It also shaped modern American literature , resulting in famous novels such as John Steinbeck 's `` The Grapes of Wrath `` and `` Of Mice and Men `` .
The Great Depression of the 1930s started with the stock market crash of October 1929 .
what country is turkey in
Turkey ( ) , officially the Republic of Turkey , is a transcontinental country , located mostly on Anatolia in Western Asia and on East Thrace in Southeastern Europe .
Turkey is bordered by eight countries : Bulgaria to the northwest ; Greece to the west ; Georgia to the northeast ; Armenia , Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the east ; and Iraq and Syria to the southeast .
The Mediterranean Sea is to the south ; the Aegean Sea is to the west ; and the Black Sea is to the north .
The Sea of Marmara , the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles ( which together form the Turkish Straits ) demarcate the boundary between Thrace and Anatolia ; they also separate Europe and Asia .
Turkey 's location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant geostrategic importance .
The country 's official language is Turkish , a Turkic language , which is spoken by approximately 85 % of the population as mother tongue .
The most numerous ethnic group is the Turks , who constitute between 70 % and 75 % of the population according to The World Factbook .
Kurds are the largest ethnic minority and , according to the same source , number around 18 % of the population while other ethnic minorities are estimated to be at 7–12 % .
The vast majority of the population is Muslim .
The area now called Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic , including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations and Thracian peoples .
After Alexander the Great 's conquest , the area was Hellenized , which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the Byzantine Empire .
The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , starting the process of Turkification , which was greatly accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 .
The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , upon which it disintegrated into several small Turkish beyliks .
Starting from the late 13th century , the Ottoman beylik united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe , Western Asia and North Africa .
After the Ottoman Empire collapsed following its defeat in World War I , parts of it were occupied by the victorious Allies .
A cadre of young military officers , led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues , organized a successful resistance to the Allies ; in 1923 they established the modern Republic of Turkey , with Atatürk as its first president .
Turkey is a democratic , secular , unitary , constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage .
Turkey has become increasingly integrated with the West through membership in organisations such as the Council of Europe , NATO , OECD , OSCE and the G-20 major economies .
Turkey began full membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005 , having been an associate member of the European Economic Community since 1963 and having joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 .
Turkey has also fostered close cultural , political and economic relations with the Middle East , Caucasus , the Turkic states of Central Asia and the African countries through membership in organisations such as the Turkic Council , Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture , Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organisation .
Turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power .
Turkey is the world 's 17th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 16th largest by purchasing power parity .

what do people usually give up for lent
Lent celebrants carrying out a street procession during Holy Week .
The violet color is often associated with penance and detachment .
Similar Christian penitential practice is seen in other Catholic countries , sometimes associated with mortification of the flesh .
Granada , Nicaragua .
Lent ( Latin : Quadragesima ) is a solemn observance in the liturgical year of many Christian denominations , lasting for a period of approximately six weeks leading up to Easter Sunday .
In the general Latin-rite and most Western denominations Lent is taken to run from Ash Wednesday to Maundy Thursday ( Holy Thursday ) morning or to Easter Eve .
In the Catholic Church , Lent lasts until Holy Thursday , while other denominations run until Easter Eve .
The traditional purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer through prayer , penance , repentance , almsgiving , and self-denial .
Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week , marking the death , burial and resurrection of Jesus , which recalls the events of the Bible when Jesus is crucified on Good Friday , which then culminates in the celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ .
During Lent , many of the faithful commit to fasting or giving up certain types of luxuries as a form of penitence .
The Stations of the Cross , a devotional commemoration of Christ 's carrying the Cross and of his execution , are often observed .
Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars , while crucifixes , religious statues , and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event .
In certain pious Catholic countries , some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat .
In some countries , grand religious processions and cultural customs are observed , and the faithful attempt to visit seven churches during Holy Week in honor of Jesus Christ heading to Mount Calvary .
Lent is traditionally described as lasting for forty days , in commemoration of the forty days which , according to the Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke , Jesus spent fasting in the desert before the beginning of his public ministry , where he endured temptation by the Devil .
However , different Christian denominations calculate the forty days of Lent differently .
In most Western traditions the Sundays are not counted as part of Lent ; thus the period from Ash Wednesday until Easter consists of 40 days when the Sundays are excluded .
However in the Roman Catholic Church Lent is now taken to end on Holy Thursday rather than Easter Eve , and hence lasts 38 days excluding Sundays , or 44 days in total .
This event , along with its pious customs are observed by Catholics , Lutherans , Methodists , Presbyterians , and Anglicans .
how did the chernobyl nuclear disaster affect nature

The Chernobyl disaster ( , Chornobylska Katastrofa – Chornobyl Catastrophe ) was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine ( then officially the Ukrainian SSR ) , which was under the direct jurisdiction of the central authorities of the Soviet Union .
An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe .
The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history , and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale ( the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 ) .
The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles .
The official Soviet casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed , and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for .
how do you use a subjective complement
In grammar , a subject complement is a predicative expression that follows a linking verb ( copula ) and that complements ( completes ) the subject of the sentence by either ( 1 ) renaming it or ( 2 ) describing it .
In the former case , a renaming noun phrase such as a noun or pronoun is called a predicative nominal .
An adjective following the copula and describing the subject is called a predicative adjective .
In either case the predicative complement in effect mirrors the subject .
Subject complements are used with a small class of verbs called linking verbs or copula , of which be is the most common .
Since copula are stative verbs , subject complements are not affected by any action of the verb .
Subject complements are typically not clause arguments , nor are they clause adjuncts .

how many feet in an acre
The acre is a unit of area used in the imperial and U.S. customary systems .
An acre is about 40 % of a hectare – slightly smaller than an American football field .
The acre is no longer commonly used , although a few notable exceptions include the United States , Australia , Burma and the United Kingdom ( as of 2010 , the acre is no longer officially used in the United Kingdom , though is still used in real estate descriptions ) .
It is still used , to some extent , in Canada .
The international symbol of the acre is ac , and is defined as 1/640 of a square mile .
The most commonly used acre today is the international acre .
In the United States both the international acre and the slightly different US survey acre are in use .
The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land .
One international acre is defined as 4046.8564224 square metres .
During the Middle Ages , an acre was the amount of land that could be plowed in one day with a yoke of oxen .
What implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?
Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th century .
Joseph Proust 's law of definite proportions and John Dalton 's atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier .
Lavoisier 's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston .
The law of conservation of mass , or principle of mass conservation , states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy ( both of which have mass ) , the mass of the system must remain constant over time , as system mass can not change quantity if it is not added or removed .
Hence , the quantity of mass is `` conserved '' over time .
The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed , although it may be rearranged in space , or the entities associated with it may be changed in form , as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed .
The law implies ( requires ) that during any chemical reaction , nuclear reaction , or radioactive decay in an isolated system , the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products .
The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry , mechanics , and fluid dynamics .
Historically , mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century , and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry .
The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory , but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations , even in modern practice .
In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved , the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important , since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e . those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment .
In this circumstance , the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation , which is the first law of thermodynamics .
By contrast , for a thermodynamically closed system ( i.e. , one which is closed to exchanges of matter , but open to exchanges of non-material energy , such as heat and work , with the surroundings ) mass is ( usually ) only approximately conserved .
The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory , although the change is usually small , since relatively large amounts of such energy ( by comparison with ordinary experience ) carry only a small amount of mass ( again by ordinary standards of measurement ) .
In special relativity , mass is not converted to energy , since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into , or out of , a system .
However , certain types of matter ( a different concept ) may be converted to energy , so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process .
However , if such energy is removed from systems , they must lose the mass that is associated with it .
In general relativity , mass ( and energy ) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept , subject to different definitions , and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space .
For a discussion , see mass in general relativity .

how much data did the 3.5 inch floppy hold
8-inch , -inch , and -inch floppy disks
8-inch , -inch ( full height ) , and -inch drives
A 3.5-inch diskette 's `` floppy '' magnetic material , removed from its housing
A floppy disk , or diskette , is a disk storage medium composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium , sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles .
They are read and written by a floppy disk drive ( FDD ) .
Floppy disks , initially as media and later in and 3.5-inch ( 90 mm ) sizes , were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s well into the first decade of the 21st century .
By 2010 , computer motherboards were rarely manufactured with floppy drive support ; `` floppies could be used as an external USB drive , but `` , 8 `` , and non-standard drives could only be handled by old equipment .
While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses , especially with legacy industrial computer equipment , they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity , such as USB flash drives , portable external hard disk drives , optical discs , memory cards , and computer networks .
what does a cutter do
An animated diagram of a cutter
In baseball , a cutter , or cut fastball , is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher 's glove side as it reaches home plate .
This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball , as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball .
Some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs .
A common technique used to throw a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand .
When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch , it often results in soft contact and an easy out , due to the pitch 's movement keeping the ball away from the bat 's sweet spot .
The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower than a pitcher 's four-seam fastball .
In 2010 , the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph ; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph .
what it takes aerosmith album
`` What It Takes '' is a power ballad by American hard rock band Aerosmith .
It was written by Steven Tyler , Joe Perry , and Desmond Child .
It was released in 1990 as the third single from Aerosmith 's critically and commercially successful 1989 album Pump .
In the video The Making of Pump , A & R man John Kalodner described the song as `` a masterpiece '' .
During live performances , Tyler sings the first verse a cappella and belts out one of his signature screams right before the chorus .
The album version of the song is followed by an untitled hidden track .

how did dali 's works change over time
Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech , 1st Marqués de Dalí de Pubol ( May 11 , 1904January 23 , 1989 ) , known as Salvador Dalí ( ) , was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres , Spain .
Dalí was a skilled draftsman , best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work .
His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters .
His best-known work , The Persistence of Memory , was completed in 1931 .
Dalí 's expansive artistic repertoire included film , sculpture , and photography , in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media .
Dalí attributed his `` love of everything that is gilded and excessive , my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes '' to a self-styled `` Arab lineage '' , claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors .
Dalí was highly imaginative , and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and grandiose behavior .
His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork , to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem , and to the irritation of his critics .
what classes are considered humanities
Philosopher Plato by Silanion
The humanities are academic disciplines that study human culture , using methods that are primarily analytical , critical , or speculative , and having a significant historical element , as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences .
The humanities include ancient and modern languages , literature , philosophy , religion , and visual and performing arts such as music and theatre .
The humanities that are also regarded as social sciences include history , anthropology , area studies , communication studies , cultural studies , law , economics and linguistics .
Scholars working in the humanities are sometimes described as `` humanists '' .
However , that term also describes the philosophical position of humanism , which some `` antihumanist `` scholars in the humanities reject .
Some secondary schools offer humanities classes , usually consisting of English literature , global studies , and art .
Human disciplines like history , cultural anthropology and psychoanalysis study subject matters to which the experimental method does not apply , and they have access instead to the comparative method and comparative research .
what christmas tree did white house have in 2011 AND where was it from
The 2005 Blue Room Christmas Tree
The White House Christmas Tree , also known as the Blue Room Christmas Tree , is the official indoor Christmas tree at the residence of the President of the United States , the White House .
The first indoor Christmas tree was installed in the White House sometime in the 19th century ( there are varying claims as to the exact year ) and since 1961 the tree has had a themed motif at the discretion of the First Lady of the United States .
what does the president of the usa do
The President of the United States of America ( POTUS ) is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and charges him with the execution of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory , and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers , with the advice and consent of the Senate .
The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances .
Since the founding of the United States , the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially and each modern president , despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills , is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States .
The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world .
The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term , and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers , the other being the Vice President of the United States .
The Twenty-second Amendment , adopted in 1951 , prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term .
It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president , or acting president , for more than two years of another person 's term as president .
In all , 43 individuals have served 55 four-year terms .
On January 20 , 2009 , Barack Obama became the 44th and current president .
On November 6 , 2012 , he was re-elected and is scheduled to serve until January 20 , 2017 .
how does taste differ from the other senses ?
Senses are physiological capacities of organisms that provide data for perception .
The senses and their operation , classification , and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields , most notably neuroscience , cognitive psychology ( or cognitive science ) , and philosophy of perception .
The nervous system has a specific sensory system or organ , dedicated to each sense .
Humans have a multitude of senses .
Sight ( ophthalmoception ) , hearing ( audioception ) , taste ( gustaoception ) , smell ( olfacoception or olfacception ) , and touch ( tactioception ) are the five traditionally recognized .
While the ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by the traditional senses exists , including temperature ( thermoception ) , kinesthetic sense ( proprioception ) , pain ( nociception ) , balance ( equilibrioception ) , acceleration ( kinesthesioception ) , and various internal stimuli ( e.g . the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood ) , only a small number of these can safely be classified as separate senses in and of themselves .
What constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate , leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a sense is .
Animals also have receptors to sense the world around them , with degrees of capability varying greatly between species .
Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell , while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses .
Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways .
Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans can not , with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents .
what do Acarina eat ?
Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom .
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms .
Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization .
As of 2008 , at least 43,678 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however , there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900 .
Anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel .
Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae .
In all except the most primitive group , the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax .
Unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure .
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen .
Spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used .
It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders .
Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets .
True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order , the Mesothelae .
The main groups of modern spiders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appeared in the Triassic period , before .
A herbivorous species , Bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008 , but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders , although a few large species also take birds and lizards .
Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs , lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection , or running it down .
Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations , but the active hunters have acute vision , and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones .
Spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids , and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws .
Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females .
Males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans .
Females weave silk egg-cases , each of which may contain hundreds of eggs .
Females of many species care for their young , for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them .
A minority of species are social , building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals .
Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration , as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing .
Although most spiders live for at most two years , tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity .
While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans , scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides .
Spider silk provides a combination of lightness , strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials , and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories .
As a result of their wide range of behaviors , spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience , cruelty and creative powers .
how many seasons of grey 's anatomy are there
Grey 's Anatomy is an American television medical drama that premiered on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) , as a mid-season replacement on March 27 , 2005 .
The series has aired nine seasons , and focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns and residents as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors , while trying to maintain personal lives .
The show 's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes , who serves as an executive producer , along with Betsy Beers , Mark Gordon , Krista Vernoff , Rob Corn , Mark Wilding , and Allan Heinberg .
The series was created to be racially diverse , utilizing a color-blind casting technique .
It is primarily filmed in Los Angeles , California .
The series ' protagonist is Dr. Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) , who originally is accepted into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital .
Meredith is assigned to work under Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) , along with Dr. Cristina Yang ( Sandra Oh ) , Dr. George O'Malley ( T. R. Knight ) , Dr. Izzie Stevens ( Katherine Heigl ) , and Dr. Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) .
Following O'Malley 's death and Stevens ' departure , the hospital 's merger with Mercy West brings in Dr. Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) and Dr. April Kepner ( Sarah Drew ) , in the sixth season .
The surgical wing is primarily supervised by Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr. ) , who is eventually replaced by Dr. Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) , and later Dr. Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) .
Dr. Preston Burke ( Isaiah Washington ) departs at the conclusion of the third season , and is replaced by Dr. Erica Hahn ( Brooke Smith ) , who leaves the show during the fifth season , and later Dr. Teddy Altman ( Kim Raver ) , who departs at the end of the eighth season .
Introduced in the second season is Dr. Addison Montgomery ( Kate Walsh ) , who leaves the show at the end of the third season , in order to launch her own spin-off medical drama Private Practice .
Dr. Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) and Dr. Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) also enter the show in the second season , while the latter dies in the premiere of the ninth season .
Meredith 's half-sister , Dr. Lexie Grey ( Chyler Leigh ) , appears from season three and dies at the end of season eight .
Dr. Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) is given series regular status at the beginning of the sixth season .
Grey 's Anatomy is the highest-rated drama in the key 18–49 demographic .
Previously among the overall top-ten rated shows in the United States , Grey 's Anatomy has been well received by critics .
Considered an impact on culture , the series has received numerous awards , and has also been included in various critics ' top ten lists .
The show has produced several specials , as well as distributed all seasons to DVD , and released a collection of merchandise .
In 2012 , Grey 's Anatomy was named the fifth-highest revenue earning show , in terms of advertising per half-hour .
On May 11 , 2012 , the series was renewed for a ninth season , which premiered on September 27 , 2012 .
how is schizophrenia diagnosed ?
Schizophrenia ( or ) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses .
Common symptoms include auditory hallucinations , paranoid or bizarre delusions , or disorganized speech and thinking , and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction .
The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood , with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3–0.7 % .
Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient 's reported experiences .
Genetics , early environment , neurobiology , and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors ; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms .
Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology , although no single isolated organic cause has been found .
The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes .
Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek roots skhizein ( σχίζειν , `` to split '' ) and phrēn , phren- ( φρήν , φρεν- ; `` mind '' ) , schizophrenia does not imply a `` split personality '' , or `` multiple personality disorder '' ( which is known these days as dissociative identity disorder ) —a condition with which it is often confused in public perception .
Rather , the term means a `` splitting of mental functions '' , because of the symptomatic presentation of the illness .
The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication , which primarily suppresses dopamine ( and sometimes serotonin ) receptor activity .
Psychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment .
In more serious cases—where there is risk to self and others— involuntary hospitalization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were .
The disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition , but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion .
People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ( comorbid ) conditions , including major depression and anxiety disorders ; the lifetime occurrence of substance use disorder is almost 50 % .
Social problems , such as long-term unemployment , poverty , and homelessness are common .
The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years less than those without , the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate ( about 5 % ) .
what did paul snider , dorothy stratten 's husband look
Paul Leslie Snider ( April 15 , 1951–August 14 , 1980 ) was the estranged husband and manager of Playboy model Dorothy Stratten , whom he murdered before killing himself the same day .
how does gilgamesh consequently view his immortality
The Epic of Gilgamesh , an epic poem from Mesopotamia , is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature .
The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five independent Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh ' ( Sumerian for Gilgamesh ) , king of Uruk .
Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian .
This first combined epic , known as the `` Old Babylonian '' version , dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Shūtur eli sharrī ( `` Surpassing All Other Kings '' ) .
Only a few fragments of it have survived .
The later `` Standard Babylonian '' version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru ( `` He who Saw the Deep '' ) .
Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer , twelve-tablet version have been recovered .
Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal .
The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu .
Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh 's equal to distract him from oppressing the people of Uruk .
Together , they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian .
Later they kill the Bull of Heaven , which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances .
As a punishment for these actions , the gods sentence Enkidu to death .
The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh 's distress at Enkidu 's death , and his quest for immortality .
In order to learn the secret of eternal life , Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey .
He learns that `` The life that you are seeking you will never find .
When the gods created man they allotted to him death , but life they retained in their own keeping . ''
This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic , and then attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic .
Nevertheless , Gilgamesh 's fame lived on after his death , because of his great building projects , and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood .
The story has been translated into many different languages , and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction .
how many eukaryotic cells are in a animal ?
A eukaryote ( or ) is an organism whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes .
Eukaryotes may more formally be referred to as the taxon Eukarya or Eukaryota .
The defining membrane-bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells is the nucleus , or nuclear envelope , within which the genetic material is carried .
The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name , which comes from the Greek ( eu , `` good '' ) and ( karyon , `` nut '' or `` kernel '' ) .
Most eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria , chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus .
All large complex organisms are eukaryotes , including animals , plants and fungi .
The group also includes many unicellular organisms .
Cell division in eukaryotes is different from that in organisms without a nucleus ( Prokaryote ) .
It involves separating the duplicated chromosomes , through movements directed by microtubules .
There are two types of division processes .
In mitosis , one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells .
In meiosis , which is required in sexual reproduction , one diploid cell ( having two instances of each chromosome , one from each parent ) undergoes recombination of each pair of parental chromosomes , and then two stages of cell division , resulting in four haploid cells ( gametes ) .
Each gamete has just one complement of chromosomes , each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes .
Eukaryota appears to be monophyletic , and so makes up one of the three domains of life .
The two other domains , Bacteria and Archaea , are prokaryotes and have none of the above features .
Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things ; even in a human body there are 10 times more microbes than human cells .
However , due to their much larger size their collective worldwide biomass is estimated at about equal to that of prokaryotes .
They are considered to have first developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago .
how much did internet fraud amount to
The use of Internet services or software with Internet access to defraud victims or to otherwise take advantage of them , for example by stealing personal information , which can even lead to identity theft .
A very common form of Internet fraud is the distribution of rogue security software .
Internet services can be used to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims , to conduct fraudulent transactions , or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme .
Internet fraud can occur in chat rooms , email , message boards , or on websites .
what forces are included in the coalition force
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) is a NATO -led security mission in Afghanistan that was established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386 , as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement .
Its main purpose is to train the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions but is also engaged in the 2001-present war with insurgent groups .
ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban , al Qaeda and factional warlords , so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai .
In October 2003 , the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan , and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country .
From 2006 to 2011 , ISAF had been involved in increasingly more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
Troop contributors include from the United States , United Kingdom , NATO member states and a number of other countries .
The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varies greatly , with the United States , United Kingdom , and Canada sustaining the majority of casualties in intensive combat operations , with other contributors sustaining significantly less .
As of early 2010 , there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan but more were expected to be built in the coming years .
About 400 of these were used by American‐led NATO forces and 300 by ANSF .
what happens to the chemical composition of cocaine when you add it to alcohol
Cocaine ( benzoylmethylecgonine ) ( INN ) is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant .
The name comes from `` coca '' and the alkaloid suffix -ine , forming cocaine .
It is a stimulant , an appetite suppressant , and a topical anesthetic .
Biologically , cocaine acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor , also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor ( TRI ) .
It is addictive because of its effect on the mesolimbic reward pathway .
Unlike most molecules , cocaine has pockets with both high hydrophilic and lipophilic efficiency , violating the rule of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance .
This causes it to cross the blood–brain barrier far better than other psychoactive chemicals and may even induce blood-brain barrier breakdown .
It is illegal to possess , produce , or distribute cocaine for non-medicinal and non-government-sanctioned purposes in almost every country .

how much does the speaker of the house make '
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives ( or Speaker of the House ) is the presiding officer of the chamber .
The office was established in 1789 by Article I , Section 2 of the United States Constitution , which states in part , `` The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker ... ''
The current Speaker is John Boehner , a Republican who represents Ohio 's 8th congressional district .
The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be a Member of Congress , but no non-member has ever been elected to the office .
The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession , after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate .
Unlike some Westminster system parliaments , in which the office of Speaker is considered non-partisan , in the United States the Speaker of the House is a leadership position and the office-holder actively works to set the majority party 's legislative agenda .
The Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates , instead delegating the duty to members of the House from the majority party .
Aside from duties relating to heading the House and the majority political party , the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions , and represents his or her Congressional district .
how do you determine pump frame type
A bicycle frame is the main component of a bicycle , on to which wheels and other components are fitted .
The modern and most common frame design for an upright bicycle is based on the safety bicycle , and consists of two triangles , a main triangle and a paired rear triangle .
This is known as the diamond frame .
Frames are required to be strong , stiff and light , which they do by combining different materials and shapes .
How did the pendulum improve upon earlier clocks ?
`` Simple gravity pendulum '' model assumes no friction or air resistance .
An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors
A pendulum is a weight suspended from a so that it can swing freely .
When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position , it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position .
When released , the restoring force combined with the pendulum 's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position , swinging back and forth .
The time for one complete cycle , a left swing and a right swing , is called the period .
A pendulum swings with a specific period which depends ( mainly ) on its length .
From its discovery around 1602 by Galileo Galilei the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping , and was the world 's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s .
Pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks , and are used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers .
Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geophysical surveys , and even as a standard of length .
The word 'pendulum ' is new Latin , from the Latin pendulus , meaning 'hanging ' .
The simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum .
This is a weight ( or bob ) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a , without friction .
When given an initial push , it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude .
Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag , so the amplitude of their swings declines .
what did bull run end for the north
The First Battle of Bull Run , also known as First Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 , in Prince William County , Virginia , near the city of Manassas .
It was the first major land battle of the American Civil War .
Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion .
Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction .
McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage .
Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad and the course of the battle quickly changed .
A brigade of Virginians under a relatively unknown colonel from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood their ground and Jackson received his famous nickname , `` Stonewall Jackson '' .
The Confederates then launched a strong counterattack , and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire , many panicked and it turned into a rout as McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington , D.C .
Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties , and realized the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated .
how does weather happen
Thunderstorm near Garajau , Madeira
Weather is the state of the atmosphere , to the degree that it is hot or cold , wet or dry , calm or stormy , clear or cloudy .
Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere , just below the stratosphere .
Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity , whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time .
When used without qualification , `` weather '' is understood to be the weather of Earth .
Weather is driven by air pressure ( temperature and moisture ) differences between one place and another .
These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot , which varies by latitude from the tropics .
The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream .
Weather systems in the mid-latitudes , such as extratropical cyclones , are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow .
Because the Earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane , sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year .
On Earth 's surface , temperatures usually range ±40 °C ( −40 °F to 100 °F ) annually .
Over thousands of years , changes in Earth 's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change .
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences .
Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating .
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location .
The atmosphere is a chaotic system , so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole .
Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history , and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns .
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth .
A famous landmark in the Solar System , Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years .
However , weather is not limited to planetary bodies .
A star 's corona is constantly being lost to space , creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System .
The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind .

how many countries have english as an official language
The following is a list of sovereign states and territories where English is an official language or language of government .
In 2012 , there were 88 states in total ( 60 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign states ) .
In many countries English is the dominant language , but does not have official status .
In Australia , English is spoken by the vast majority of the population and is the only language used in government institutions , but Australia does not have an official language .
The case is the same in the United Kingdom and the United States , though many states and regions within the U.S. do have English as an official language .
English is the dominant language of New Zealand and an official language of Canada ( along with French ) , India ( along with Hindi and several other languages ) , Ireland ( along with Irish ) , and the Philippines ( along with Tagalog ) .
English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Commonwealth Games .
English is one of the official languages of the United Nations , the European Union and the International Olympic Committee .
Many of these countries are current or former colonies or dependencies of the United Kingdom ( see also British Empire ) , or of the United States , itself a former colony of the UK .
Notable exceptions include Rwanda , which was a former Belgian colony and Eritrea , which was an Italian colony where the British Empire spanned its control only in World War II and shortly after ( 1941-1952 ) .
India 's linguistic picture is complex .
According to the Constitution of India , `` Hindi in the Devanagari script '' is the official language of the union ; and English the 'subsidiary official language ' ; however , English is mandated for the authoritative texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions and ( along with Hindi ) is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament .
English is used almost exclusively for higher education , business and science .
Courses in majority of the schools are taught exclusively in English .
English is extensively used for administrative purposes in India .
India is the second-largest English-speaking country in the world by number of speakers , after the United States .
As such , many consider English to be the de facto official language of India .
See Official languages of India .
The linguistic makeup of Pakistan is similarly complex .
While the national language is Urdu , English is an official language and used in business , government and law .
English is a compulsory language in schools .
All school courses are taught in English .
Pakistan is the 9th largest English-speaking country in the world by population .
what countries are in cono sur
Southern Cone ( , ) is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America , south of the Tropic of Capricorn .
Although geographically this includes Southern and part of Southeast ( São Paulo ) of Brazil , in terms of political geography the Southern cone has traditionally comprised Argentina , Chile , Paraguay , and Uruguay .
In the narrowest sense , it only covers Argentina , Chile and Uruguay , bounded on the north by the states of Brazil , Paraguay , Bolivia and Peru , on the west by the Pacific Ocean , and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans , which it is the closest continental area of Antarctica ( 1000 km ) .
High life expectancy , the highest Human Development Index of Latin America , high Standard of living , significant participation in the global markets and the emerging economy of its members make the Southern Cone the most prosperous macro-region in South America .
how often are meetings held for businesses
For multi-event athletic competitions see Track and Field Competitions , section `` Meetings '' .
Meetings are sometimes held around conference tables .
In a meeting , two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics , often in a formal setting .
how many innings makes an official game
An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game , is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary .
This is approximately the halfway point of the game .
In the case of inclement weather , any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed , with the result being final , and all records and statistics counted .
A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game ( to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage ) , or is simply canceled and replayed from the start .
( This depends on the rules of each individual league . )
In either case , no statistics are counted until the game becomes official .
Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long , the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game .
If the visiting team is leading , or the game is tied , the end of the fifth inning marks this point .
If the home team ( which bats last ) is already ahead in the score , and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning , then 41⁄2 innings ( i.e. , the middle of the fifth ) is considered an official game .
The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning , since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth .
In nearly all cases , the `` official game '' status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets .
If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official , fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or ( in most cases ) any other available game of their choice .
If a game is halted after it becomes official , the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given .
The `` official game '' statistic received some attention during the 1995 season , when Cal Ripken , Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by Lou Gehrig .
Large numbers were hung on the side of the B & O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken 's streak .
Each day , a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official ( since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point ) .
A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums ( including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003 , Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005 , and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008 ) ; as each game became official , the team would unveil a new ( lower ) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium .
how did phone numbers get split 3 than 4
A telephone number or phone number is a sequence of digits used to call from one telephone line to another in a public switched telephone network .
When telephone numbers were invented , they were short — as few as one , two or three digits — and were given orally to a switchboard operator .
As phone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass the world , telephone numbers have become longer .
In addition to telephones , they now access other devices , such as computers and fax machines .
The number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call .
Each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched telephone network .
Most countries use fixed length numbers ( for normal lines at least ) and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number .
It is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used .
These `` shorthand '' or `` speed calling '' numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected .
Some special services have their own short numbers ( e.g. , 1-1-9 , 9-1-1 , 0-0-0 , 9-9-9 , 1-1-1 , and 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and Sri Lanka ; Canada and the United States ; Australia ; the United Kingdom , Ireland , South Africa , Poland , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Morocco , Macao , Bahrain , Qatar , Bangladesh , Botswana , Ghana , Kenya , Hong Kong , Malaysia , Mauritius , Singapore , Zimbabwe , Trinidad , Tobago ; New Zealand ; Kuwait and the European Union , respectively . )
Many systems also allow calls within a local area to be made without dialing the local area code .
For example , a phone number in North America will start with three numbers ( such as 661 ) , which is the area code , followed by seven digits split into sections of three and four ( such as 550-1212 ) , which is the local number .
Some areas now have mandatory ten-digit dialing in place , even for local calls .
Most telephone networks today ( exceptions being private intercom and secure phone networks ) are interconnected in the international telephone network , where the format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T in the recommendation E.164 .
This specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter , and begin with a country prefix .
For most countries , this is followed by an area code or city code and the subscriber number , which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange .
ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print , starting with a plus sign ( `` + '' ) and the country code .
When calling an international number from a fixed line phone , the + must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from .
Some mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly .
The format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nation 's respective government , either directly or by sponsored organizations ( such as NANPA overseen by NeuStar Inc. ) .
Before a telephone call is connected , the telephone number must be dialed by the calling party or Caller .
The called party might have equipment that presents caller ID before the call is answered .
how will a uk collection company collect money when you are in the usa
A collection agency is a business that pursues payments of debts owed by individuals or businesses .
Most collection agencies operate as agents of creditors and collect debts for a fee or percentage of the total amount owed .
There are many types of collection agencies .
First-party agencies are oftentimes subsidiaries of the original company the debt is owed to .
Third-party agencies are separate companies contracted by a company to collect debts on their behalf for a fee .
Debt buyers purchase the debt at a percentage of its value , then attempt to collect it .
Each country has its own rules and regulations regarding them .
how was marijuana discovered
Cannabis flower with visible trichomes
Cannabis , also known as marijuana ( from the Mexican Spanish marihuana ) , and by other names , is a preparation of the Cannabis plant intended for use as a psychoactive drug and as medicine .
Pharmacologically , the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) ; it is one of 483 known compounds in the plant , including at least 84 other cannabinoids , such as cannabidiol ( CBD ) , cannabinol ( CBN ) , tetrahydrocannabivarin ( THCV ) .
and cannabigerol ( CBG ) .

what branch of the military is delta force
1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta ( 1st SFOD-D ) , popularly known as Delta Force , is one of the United States ' four secretive tier-one counter-terrorism and Special Mission Units .
It was formerly listed as the Combat Applications Group by the Department of Defense but has since been officially re-designated the Army Compartmented Elements ( ACE ) .
While 1st SFOD-D is administratively supported by USASOC , it falls under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command .
Delta Force and its Navy counterpart , the Naval Special Warfare Development Group , are the United States military 's primary counter-terrorism units .
Delta Force 's primary tasks are counter-terrorism , direct action , and national intervention operations , although it is an extremely versatile group capable of conducting many types of covert missions , including , but not limited to , hostage rescues and raids .
The Central Intelligence Agency 's highly secretive Special Activities Division ( SAD ) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group ( SOG ) often works with – and recruits – operators from Delta Force .
what form of decay does not change the atomic number of them decaying atom ?
Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay , in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle , and thereby transforms ( or 'decays ' ) into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less .
Many other types of decays are possible .
Radioactive decay , also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity , is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation .
A material that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation — which includes the emission of energetic alpha particles , beta particles , and gamma rays — is considered radioactive .
There are many different types of radioactive decay ( see table below ) .
A decay , or loss of energy , results when an atom with one type of nucleus , called the parent radionuclide , transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state , or to a different nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons .
Either of these products is named the daughter nuclide .
In some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements , and thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation ( creation of an atom of a new element ) .
The first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay .
Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle ( helium nucleus ) .
This is the most common process of emitting nucleons , but in rarer types of decays , nuclei can eject protons , or specific nuclei of other elements ( in the process called cluster decay ) .
Beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of neutrino , in a process that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way around .
The nucleus may capture an orbiting electron , converting a proton into a neutron ( electron capture ) .
All of these processes result in nuclear transmutation .
By contrast , there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutation .
The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in gamma decay , or used to eject an orbital electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion .
Radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons , and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to another .
One type of radioactive decay results in products which are not defined , but appear in a range of `` pieces '' of the original nucleus .
This decay is called spontaneous fission .
This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two ( and occasionally three ) smaller daughter nuclei , and usually emits gamma rays , neutrons , or other particles as a consequence .
Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e. , random ) process at the level of single atoms , in that , according to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay .
However , the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time .
For a large number of atoms , the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides ( or equivalently from the half-lifes ) .
how long does a back waxing last
Waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root .
New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for two to eight weeks , although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week .
Almost any area of the body can be waxed , including eyebrows , face , bikini area , legs , arms , back , abdomen and feet .
There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair .
Strip waxing is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin .
A cloth or paper strip is then pressed on the top and ripped off the direction of hair growth .
This removes the wax along with the hair .
Strip wax can also be made at home using lemon juice , water , sugar and honey .
Hot waxing utilizes Hot wax ( as opposed to strip wax ) .
In this case , the wax is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips .
The wax then hardens when it cools , thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths .
This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin .
what ancient cultures had marketplaces
Wall painting ( 1st century AD ) from Pompeii depicting a multigenerational banquet
Ancient Roman culture existed throughout the almost 1200-year history of the civilization of Ancient Rome .
The term refers to the culture of the Roman Republic , later the Roman Empire , which , at its peak , covered an area from Lowland Scotland and Morocco to the Euphrates .
Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome , its famed seven hills , and its monumental structures such as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( now called the Colosseum ) , the Forum of Trajan , and the Pantheon .
The city also had several theaters , gymnasiums , and many taverns , baths , and brothels .
Throughout the territory under ancient Rome 's control , residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas , and in the capital city of Rome , there were imperial residences on the elegant Palatine Hill , from which the word palace is derived .
The vast majority of the population lived in the city center , packed into insulae ( apartment blocks ) .
The city of Rome was the largest megalopolis of that time , with a population that may well have exceeded one million people , with a high end estimate of 3.6 million and a low end estimate of 450,000 .
Historical estimates indicate that around 30 percent of the population under the city 's jurisdiction lived in innumerable urban centers , with population of at least 10,000 and several military settlements , a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards .
The most urbanized part of the Empire was Italy , which had an estimated rate of urbanization of 32 % , the same rate of urbanization of England in 1800 .
Most Roman towns and cities had a forum , temples and the same type of buildings , on a smaller scale , as found in Rome .
The large urban population required an endless supply of food which was a complex logistical task , including acquiring , transporting , storing and distribution of food for Rome and other urban centers .
Italian farms supplied vegetables and fruits , but fish and meat were luxuries .
Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and oil were imported from Hispania , Gaul and Africa .
There was a very large amount of commerce between the provinces of the Roman Empire , since its transportation technology was very efficient .
The average costs of transport and the technology were comparable with 18th-century Europe .
The later city of Rome did not fill the space within its ancient Aurelian walls until after 1870 .
Eighty percent of the population under the jurisdiction of ancient Rome lived in the countryside in settlements with less than 10 thousand inhabitants .
Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers .
The plight of rural slaves was generally worse than their counterparts working in urban aristocratic households .
To stimulate a higher labor productivity most landlords freed a large number of slaves and many received wages .
Some records indicate that `` as many as 42 people lived in one small farm hut in Egypt , while six families owned a single olive tree . '' .
Such a rural environment continued to induce migration of population to urban centers until the early 2nd century , when the urban population stopped growing and started to decline .
Starting in the middle of the 2nd century BC , private Greek culture was increasingly in ascendancy , in spite of tirades against the `` softening '' effects of Hellenized culture from the conservative moralists .
By the time of Augustus , cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young ( sometimes even the girls ) ; chefs , decorators , secretaries , doctors , and hairdressers—all came from the Greek East .
Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas , or were imitated in Roman sculpture yards by Greek slaves .
The Roman cuisine preserved in the cookery books ascribed to Apicius is essentially Greek .
Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style .
Only in law and governance was the Italic nature of Rome 's accretive culture supreme .
Against this human background , both the urban and rural setting , one of history 's most influential civilizations took shape , leaving behind a cultural legacy that survives in part today .

what causes the seasons
A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .
Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
In temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants to be dormant .
During May , June and July , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun .
The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November , December and January .
It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
However , due to seasonal lag , June , July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December , January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere .
In temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) .
However , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four .
Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season .
In some parts of the world , special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season , tornado season or a wildfire season .

what happened on april 11 1861 at fort sumter
The Battle of Fort Sumter ( April 12–14 , 1861 ) was the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter , near Charleston , South Carolina , that started the American Civil War .
Following declarations of secession by seven Southern states , South Carolina demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor .
On December 26 , 1860 , U.S. Major Robert Anderson surreptitiously moved his small command from the indefensible Fort Moultrie on Sullivan 's Island to Fort Sumter , a substantial fortress controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor .
An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson , using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West , failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9 , 1861 .
South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area , except for Fort Sumter .
During the early months of 1861 , the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege .
In March , Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard , the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States of America , was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston .
Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter .
Conditions in the fort grew dire as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns .
Anderson was short of men , food , and supplies .
The resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of President Abraham Lincoln .
He notified the Governor of South Carolina , Francis W. Pickens , that he was sending supply ships , which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government : evacuate Fort Sumter immediately .
Major Anderson refused to surrender .
Beginning at 4:30 a.m. on April 12 , the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor .
Although the Union garrison returned fire , they were significantly outgunned and , after 34 hours , Major Anderson agreed to evacuate .
There was no loss of life on either side as a direct result of this engagement , although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths .
Following the battle , there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action .
Lincoln 's immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern slave states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy .
The Civil War had begun .

How Do You Get Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver , caused by the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) .
The infection is often asymptomatic , but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis , which is generally apparent after many years .
In some cases , those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure , liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices .
HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use , poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions .
An estimated 130–200 million people worldwide are infected with .
The existence of ( originally `` non- A non- B hepatitis '' ) was postulated in the 1970s and proven in 1989 .
only infects humans and chimpanzees .
The virus persists in the liver in about 85 % of those infected .
This persistent infection can be treated with medication : the standard therapy is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin , with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in some cases .
Overall , 50–80 % of people treated are cured .
Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant .
is the leading cause of liver transplantation , though the virus usually recurs after transplantation .
No vaccine against is available .
how does flexible spending account work
A flexible spending account ( FSA ) , also known as a flexible spending arrangement , is one of a number of tax-advantaged financial accounts that can be set up through a cafeteria plan of an employer in the United States .
An FSA allows an employee to set aside a portion of earnings to pay for qualified expenses as established in the cafeteria plan , most commonly for medical expenses but often for dependent care or other expenses .
Money deducted from an employee 's pay into an FSA is not subject to payroll taxes , resulting in substantial payroll tax savings .
One significant disadvantage to using an FSA is that funds not used by the end of the plan year are lost to the employee , known as the `` use it or lose it '' rule .
The most common type of flexible spending account , the medical expense FSA ( also medical FSA or health FSA ) , is similar to a health savings account ( HSA ) or a health reimbursement account ( HRA ) .
However , while HSAs and HRAs are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer driven health care plan , medical FSAs are commonly offered with more traditional health plans as well .
In addition , funds in a health savings account are not lost when the plan year is over , unlike funds in an FSA .
Paper forms or an FSA debit card , also known as a Flexcard , may be used to access the account funds .
how tennessee became a state
Tennessee ( ) ( ) is a U.S. state located in the Southeastern United States .
Tennessee is the 36th most extensive and the 17th most populous of the 50 United States .
Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north , North Carolina to the east , Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi to the south , and Arkansas and Missouri to the west .
The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state , and the Mississippi River forms the state 's western border .
Tennessee 's capital and second largest city is Nashville , which has a population of 609,644 .
Memphis is the state 's largest city , with a population of 652,050 .
The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians .
What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina , and later part of the Southwest Territory .
Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1 , 1796 .
Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861 , and the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war .
Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state , and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state .
In the 20th century , Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy , aided at times by federal entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority .
In the early 1940s , the city of Oak Ridge was established to house the Manhattan Project 's uranium enrichment facilities , helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb .
Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music , including rock and roll , blues , country , and rockabilly .
Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues , with musicians such as W.C . Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909 .
Memphis was also home to Sun Records , where musicians such as Elvis Presley , Isaac Hayes , Johnny Cash , Carl Perkins , Jerry Lee Lewis , Roy Orbison , and Charlie Rich began their recording careers , and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s .
The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry .
Three bricks and mortar museums recognize Tennessee 's role in nurturing various forms of popular music : the Memphis Rock N ' Soul Museum , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville , and the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson .
In addition , the Rockabilly Hall of Fame , an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which Tennessee played a crucial role , is based in Nashville .
Tennessee 's major industries include agriculture , manufacturing , and tourism .
Poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products , and major manufacturing exports include chemicals , transportation equipment , and electrical equipment .
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park , the nation 's most visited national park , is headquartered in the eastern part of the state , and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border .
Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga , the Sunsphere in Knoxville , Dollywood in Pigeon Forge , the Parthenon , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville , and Elvis Presley 's Graceland residence and tomb in Memphis .
how long should i wear my cock ring
One design variant of a cock ring .
A cock ring is a ring that can be placed around a man 's penis , usually at the base , primarily to slow the flow of blood from the erect penile tissue , thus maintaining an erection for a much longer period of time .
Cock rings can be worn around just the penis or both the penis and scrotum , or just the scrotum alone , though this is usually called a testicle cuff .
Rings can be made of a variety of different materials , most commonly leather , rubber , or silicone , though nylon and metal are also used either as the main component or part of the closure .
The term cock ring is sometimes used as a synonym for a Prince Albert piercing , a piercing of the penis that is usually , though not always , a metal ring .
When used in cases of erectile dysfunction they are known by various names such as `` erection ring '' and `` tension ring '' .
how many baseball teams usa
The headquarters of Major League Baseball at 245 Park Avenue , Midtown Manhattan , New York City , USA .
Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is a professional baseball league , consisting of teams that play in the National League and the American League .
Dating to 1876 and 1901 respectively , the two leagues merged in 2000 into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball , after 100 years as separate legal entities .
MLB constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada .
It is composed of 30 teams — 29 in the United States and one in Canada .
Teams in MLB play 162 games each season over six months ( April through September ) .
Five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series , a best-of-seven-games championship series between the two league champions which dates to 1903 .
The organization oversees many minor-league baseball leagues which operate about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs .
With the International Baseball Federation , the league also manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament .
MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in the world with nearly 75 million spectators in 2012 .
how does Delaware support its claim to being the first state ?
Delaware ( ) is a U.S. state located on the Atlantic Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States .
It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland , to the northeast by New Jersey , and to the north by Pennsylvania .
The state takes its name from Thomas West , 3rd Baron De La Warr , an English nobleman and Virginia 's first colonial governor , after whom what is now called Cape Henlopen was originally named .
Delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and is the second smallest , the sixth least populous , but the sixth most densely populated of the fifty United States .
Delaware is divided into three counties .
From north to south , these three counties are New Castle , Kent , and Sussex .
While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural , New Castle County has been more industrialized .
Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south .
It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael , located near the present town of Lewes , in 1631 .
Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American Revolution and on December 7 , 1787 , became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States , thereby becoming known as The First State .
what can electrical energy be transformed into
Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language
Energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to another .
In physics , the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system , without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by Entropy .
Changes in total energy of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them , as energy is a quantity which is conserved , according to the first law of thermodynamics .
According to special relativity , changes in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the system 's mass , and the total amount of mass of a system is a measure of its energy .
Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state , or a different type of energy .
Energy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work .
Energy may be used in natural processes or machines , or else to provide some service to society ( such as heat , light , or motion ) .
For example , an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat , which is then transformed into the propulsive energy ( kinetic energy that moves a vehicle ) .
A solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computer .
The generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another , is a transducer .
In general , most types of energy , save for thermal energy , may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energy .
Sometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 % , such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum , or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object , in space .
Conversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency ( many types of friction do this ) .
Exceptions for perfect conversion efficiency ( even for isolated systems ) occur when energy has already been partly distributed among many available quantum states for a collection of particles , which are freely allowed to explore any state of momentum and position ( phase space ) .
In such circumstances , a measure called Entropy , or evening-out of energy distribution in such states , dictates that future states of the system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution .
( There is no way , taking the universe as a whole , to collect energy into fewer states , once it has spread to them ) .
A consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy , since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states .
Such energy is sometimes considered `` degraded energy , '' because it is not entirely usable .
The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that , for this reason , thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 % , only if the entropy ( even-ness or disorder ) of the universe is increased by other means , to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content .
Otherwise , only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy ( and thus , useful work ) , since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature , in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy .
how many teams start nhl playoffs
The National Hockey League ( NHL ; ) is an `` unincorporated not-for-profit association '' which operates a major professional ice hockey league of 30 franchised member clubs , of which seven are currently located in Canada and 23 in the United States .
Headquartered in New York City , the NHL is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada .
The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season .
The league was organized on November 26 , 1917 , in Montreal , Quebec , Canada , after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 .
It started with four teams and , through a series of expansions , contractions , and relocations , the league is now composed of 30 active franchises .
The nation to which the name of the league originally referred was Canada , although the league has now been binational since 1924 when it expanded into the United States .
After a labour dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 season , the league resumed play under a new collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap .
In 2009 , the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships , attendance , and television audiences .
The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries .
Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the NHL , over the past four plus decades the percentages of US and European players have increased both because of the NHL 's continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967 , and the increased availability of highly skilled European players .
how many amendments in the US constitution
This is the complete list of the ratified and unratified amendments to the United States Constitution which received the approval of the United States Congress .
Twenty-seven amendments have been ratified since the original signing of the Constitution , the first ten of which are known collectively as the Bill of Rights .
The procedure for amending the United States Constitution is governed by Article V of the original text .
There have been many other proposals for amendments to the United States Constitution introduced in Congress , but not submitted to the states .
Before an amendment can take effect , it must be proposed to the states by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or by a convention ( known as an Article V convention ) called by two-thirds of the states , and ratified by three-fourths of the states or by three-fourths of conventions thereof , the method of ratification being determined by Congress at the time of proposal .
To date , no convention for proposing amendments has been called by the states , and only once—in 1933 for the ratification of the twenty-first amendment —has the convention method of ratification been employed .

how is sociology different from thinking
Sociology is the scientific study of human society and its origins , development , organizations , and institutions .
It is a social science which uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about human social activity , structures , and functions .
A goal for many sociologists is to conduct research which may be applied directly to social policy and welfare , while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes .
Subject matter ranges from the micro level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure .
The traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification , social class , culture , race and ethnicity , gender and sexuality , social mobility , religion , secularization , law , and deviance .
As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency , sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects , such as health , medical , military and penal institutions , the Internet , environmental sociology , political economy and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge .
The range of social scientific methods has also expanded .
Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques .
The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative , hermeneutic , and philosophic approaches to the analysis of society .
Conversely , recent decades have seen the rise of new analytically , mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques , such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis .
Sociology should not be confused with various general social studies courses which bear little relation to sociological theory or social science research methodology .
what causes thunder sound
Thunder is the sound caused by lightning .
Depending on the nature of the lightning and distance of the listener , thunder can range from a sharp , loud crack to a long , low rumble ( brontide ) .
The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning .
In turn , this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave , similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder , often referred to as a clap , crack , or peal of thunder .
The distance of the lightning can be calculated by the listener based on the time interval from when the lightning is seen to when the sound is heard .
what do do the colors on the flag of palma de mallorca mean ?
Palma ( , , ) , in full Palma de Mallorca , is the major city and port on the island of Majorca ( Mallorca ) and capital city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain .
The names Ciutat de Mallorca ( City of Majorca ) and Ciutat ( City ) were used before the War of the Spanish Succession and are still used by people in Majorca .
However , the official name was Mallorca , the same as the island .
It is situated on the south coast of the island on the Bay of Palma .
As of the 2009 census , the population of the city of Palma proper was 401,270 , and the population of the entire urban area was 517,285 , ranking as the twelfth largest urban area of Spain .
Almost half of the total population of Majorca live in Palma .
The Cabrera Archipelago , though widely separated from Palma proper , is administratively considered part of the municipality .
Its airport , Son Sant Joan , serves over 22 million passengers each year .
The Marivent Palace was offered by the city to the then Prince Juan Carlos I of Spain .
The royals have since spent their summer holidays in Palma .
how does lex luthor die in superman
Luthor redirects here .
For other uses , see Luther ( disambiguation ) .
Alexander Joseph `` Lex '' Luthor is a fictional character , a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics .
Luthor is the archenemy of Superman , and as a high-status supervillain , has also come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe .
Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the character first appeared in Action Comics # 23 ( April 1940 ) .
Luthor is described as `` a power-mad , evil scientist '' of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess .
Luthor 's goals typically center on killing Superman , the foremost obstacle to achieving the villain 's megalomaniacal goals .
Despite periodically wearing a powered exoskeleton , Luthor has traditionally lacked superpowers or a dual identity .
The character was originally depicted as a mad scientist who , in the vein of pulp novels , wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry .
In his earliest appearances , Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair .
Despite this , the character later became hairless as the result of an artist 's mistake .
A 1960 story by Jerry Siegel expanded upon Luthor 's origin and motivations , revealing him to be a childhood friend of Superman 's who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory ; Luthor vowed revenge .
Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , the character was re-imagined as a Machiavellian industrialist and white-collar criminal , even briefly serving as President of the United States .
In recent years , various writers have revived Luthor 's mad scientist persona from the 1940s .
The character was ranked as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list .
IGN 's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Luthor as # 4 .
Luthor is also described as a `` megavillain '' by comic book critic Peter Sanderson , one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place `` in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended '' ; characters such as Professor Moriarty , Count Dracula , Hannibal Lecter , Doctor Doom , and Darth Vader , also fit this description .
what day is the federal holiday for Martin Luther King Jr .
Martin Luther King , Jr. Day is a United States federal holiday marking the birthday of Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .
It is observed on the third Monday of January each year , which is around the time of King 's birthday , January 15 .
The floating holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act , though the act predated the establishment of Martin Luther King , Jr. Day by 15 years .
King was the chief spokesman for nonviolent activism in the civil rights movement , which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law .
The campaign for a federal holiday in King 's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968 .
Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983 , and it was first observed on January 20 , 1986 .
At first , some states resisted observing the holiday as such , giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays .
It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000 .
how many camera phones
The camera phone solution allows instant sharing of pictures .
As it 's automatic and instant , the user does not have to use a cable or removable media to connect to a personal computer .
A camera phone is a mobile phone which is able to capture still photographs ( and usually video ) .
Since early in the 21st century the majority of mobile phones in use are camera phones .
Most camera phones are simpler than separate digital cameras .
Their usual fixed focus lenses and smaller sensors limit their performance in poor lighting .
Lacking a physical shutter , most have a long shutter lag .
Flash , where present , is usually weak .
Optical zoom and tripod screws are rare .
Some also lack a USB connection , removable memory card , or other way of transferring their pictures more quickly than by the phone 's inherent communication feature .
Some of the more expensive camera phones have only a few of these technical disadvantages , which apply most acutely in low light conditions and in any case have not inhibited their widespread use .
Most model lines improve in these regards every year or two .
Some , such as the Droid Incredible only have a menu choice to start an application program to activate the camera .
Others , such as the BlackBerry Storm 2 , Droid X , Motorola V980 and Nokia 5800 also have a separate camera button for quickness and convenience .
Windows Phones can be configured to operate as a camera even if the phone is asleep .
Some camera phones are designed to resemble separate low-end digital compact cameras in appearance and to some extent in features and picture quality , and are branded as both mobile phones and cameras , including certain Sony phones .
The principal advantages of camera phones are cost and compactness ; indeed for a user who carries a mobile phone anyway , the additional size and cost are negligible .
Smartphones that are camera phones may run mobile applications to add capabilities such as geotagging and image stitching .
A few high end phones can use their touch screen to direct their camera to focus on a particular object in the field of view , giving even an inexperienced user a degree of focus control exceeded only by seasoned photographers using manual focus .
what happened to superman in the comics
`` Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow ? '' is a 1986 comic book story featuring the DC Comics character of Superman .
Written by Alan Moore with help from long-time , and soon to be retiring , Superman editor , Julius Schwartz , the story was published in two parts , beginning in Superman # 423 and ending in Action Comics # 583 , both published in September 1986 .
The story was drawn by long-time artist Curt Swan , in his final major contribution to the Superman titles , and was inked by George Pérez in the issue of Superman and Kurt Schaffenberger in the issue of Action Comics .
The story was an imaginary tale which told the final story of the Silver Age Superman and his long history , which was being rebooted following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths , before his modern introduction in the John Byrne series , The Man of Steel .
Moore wanted his plot to honor the long history of the character and to serve as a complete conclusion to his mythology .
The story is a frame story set ten years after Superman was last seen , where Lois Lane recounts the tale of the end of Superman 's career to a reporter from the Daily Planet .
Her story includes numerous violent attacks against Superman by his enemies , the public revelation of his secret identity of Clark Kent and a number of deaths of those closest to him .
The story has been cited as one of the best stories of the character of Superman , and critics and audiences frequently choose it as one of the most memorable comics ever published .
It is used as an example of how to close the long-time continuity of a comic book character .
The story 's legacy has endured with similar stories written as tributes to it .
The title is a reference to one of the nicknames of Superman as the Man of Tomorrow , and was used in the title of another Superman .

what does it mean to take communion in the catholic church
The institution of the Eucharist has been a key theme in the depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art , as in this 16th-century Juan de Juanes painting .
`` At the Last Supper , on the night he was betrayed , our Savior instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood . ''
( Catechism of the Catholic Church 1323 )
Eucharist in the Catholic Church refers to both the celebration of the Mass , that is , the Eucharist liturgy , and the bread and wine which after the consecration are transubstantiated ( changed in substance ) into the body and blood of Jesus Christ , Lord and God , a declaration formulated by the Council of Trent with an anathema against anyone who denied this .
Blessed Sacrament is a devotional term used in the Roman Catholic Church to refer to the Eucharistic species ( the Body and Blood of Christ ) .

how many words are in a short story
A short story is a brief work of literature , usually written in narrative prose .
Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century , the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization .
At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters , and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a `` single effect '' or mood .
In so doing , short stories make use of plot , resonance , and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote , yet to a far lesser degree than a novel .
While the short story is largely distinct from the novel , authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques .
Short stories have no set length .
In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an anecdote , a short story , and a novel .
Rather , the form 's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered , so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres , countries , eras , and commentators .
Like the novel , the short story 's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication , and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses .
The short story has been considered both an apprenticeship form preceding more lengthy works , and a crafted form in its own right , collected together in books of similar length , price , and distribution as novels .
Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form .
They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed form .

how many babies are in a typical raccoon litter
The raccoon ( , Procyon lotor ) , sometimes spelled racoon , also known as the common raccoon , North American raccoon , northern raccoon and colloquially as coon , is a medium-sized mammal native to North America .
The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family , having a body length of and a body weight of .
Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates against cold weather .
Two of the raccoon 's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask , which are themes in the mythology of several Native American tribes .
Raccoons are noted for their intelligence , with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years .
The diet of the omnivorous raccoon , which is usually nocturnal , consists of about 40 % invertebrates , 33 % plant foods , and 27 % vertebrates .
The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests , but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas , coastal marshes , and urban areas , where some homeowners consider them to be pests .
As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century , raccoons are now also distributed across the European mainland , the Caucasus region and Japan .
Though previously thought to be solitary , there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific social behavior .
Related females often share a common area , while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season , and other potential invaders .
Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares ( 7 acres ) for females in cities to 50 km2 ( 20 sq mi ) for males in prairies .
After a gestation period of about 65 days , two to five young , known as `` kits '' , are born in spring .
The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersion in late fall .
Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years , their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years .
In many areas , hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death .
what kind of earthquake was haiti
The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake , with an epicenter near the town of Léogâne ( Ouest Department ) , approximately west of Port-au-Prince , Haiti 's capital .
The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time ( 21:53 UTC ) on Tuesday , 12 January 2010 .
By 24 January , at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded .
An estimated three million people were affected by the quake .
The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000 .
Haitian government estimates were higher .
The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged .
The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince , Jacmel and other settlements in the region .
Many notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed , including the Presidential Palace , the National Assembly building , the Port-au-Prince Cathedral , and the main jail .
Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot , and opposition leader Micha Gaillard .
The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ( MINUSTAH ) , located in the capital , collapsed , killing many , including the Mission 's Chief , Hédi Annabi .
Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid , pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams , engineers and support personnel .
Communication systems , air , land , and sea transport facilities , hospitals , and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake , which hampered rescue and aid efforts ; confusion over who was in charge , air traffic congestion , and problems with prioritisation of flights further complicated early relief work .
Port-au-Prince 's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies .
These had to be buried in mass graves .
As rescues tailed off , supplies , medical care and sanitation became priorities .
Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors , and looting and sporadic violence were observed .
On 22 January the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close , and on the following day the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors .
what kind of horse was mr ed
Mister Ed is a fictional talking horse , originally appearing in short stories by Walter R. Brooks , and later in an American television situation comedy produced by Filmways that first aired in syndication from January 5 to July 2 , 1961 , and then on CBS from October 1 , 1961 to February 6 , 1966 .
The stars of the show were Mister Ed , a palomino horse who could `` talk '' , played by gelding Bamboo Harvester and voiced by former Western star Allan Lane ( who went uncredited for the entire length of the series ) , and his owner , an eccentric and enormously klutzy , yet friendly , architect named Wilbur Post ( Alan Young ) .
Much of the program 's humor stemmed from the fact Mister Ed would speak only to Wilbur , as well as Ed 's notoriety as a troublemaker .
Other running jokes centered on Wilbur 's character being a huge klutz and inadvertently causing harm to himself or others .
According to the show 's producer , Arthur Lubin , Young was chosen as the lead character because he `` just seemed like the sort of guy a horse would talk to '' .
Lubin , a friend of Mae West , scored a coup by persuading the screen icon to guest star in one episode .
In the United States , reruns aired on Nick at Nite from March 3 , 1986 , to February 1 , 1993 .
Sister station TV Land also reran the show from 1996–98 and again from 2003-06 .
The series is currently broadcast every morning on This TV , along with Highway Patrol , and The Patty Duke Show .
It is also currently broadcast on Hallmark Movie Channel .
As of January 1 , 2011 , the first two seasons of the show are available on Hulu .
What does Rapture meaning in a theological sense ?
The Rapture is a term in Christian eschatology which refers to the `` being caught up '' discussed in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 , when the `` dead in Christ '' and `` we who are alive and remain '' will be `` caught up in the clouds '' to meet `` the Lord in the air '' .
The term `` Rapture '' is used in at least two senses .
In the pre-tribulation view , a group of people will be left behind on earth after another group literally leaves `` to meet the Lord in the air . ''
This is now the most common use of the term , especially among fundamentalist Christians and in the United States .
The other , older use of the term `` Rapture '' is simply as a synonym for the final resurrection generally , without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 .
This distinction is important as some types of Christianity never refer to `` the Rapture '' in religious education , but might use the older and more general sense of the word `` rapture '' in referring to what happens during the final resurrection .
There are many views among Christians regarding the timing of Christ 's return ( including whether it will occur in one event or two ) , and various views regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4 .
Denominations such as Roman Catholics , Orthodox Christians , Lutheran Christians , and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection , when Christ returns a single time .
They do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 .
Pre-tribulation rapture theology was developed in the 1830s by John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren , and popularized in the United States in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the Scofield Reference Bible .

where in the bible that palestine have no land in jerusalem
The Philistine cities of Gaza , Ashdod , Ashkelon , Ekron , and Gath
The Philistines ( , , , or ; , Plištim ) , Pleshet or Peleset , were a people who as part of the Sea Peoples appeared in the southern coastal area of Canaan at the beginning of the Iron Age ( circa 1175 BC ) , most probably from the Aegean region .
According to the Bible , they ruled the five city-states ( the `` Philistine Pentapolis '' ) of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron and Gath , from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north , but with no fixed border to the east .
The Bible paints them as the Kingdom of Israel 's most dangerous enemy .
Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC , rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC , of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total , and perhaps much less .
Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines , however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population .
There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were Indo-European-speakers either from Greece and/or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor .
Philistine-related words found in the Bible are not Semitic , and can in some cases , with reservations , be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots .
By the beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE they had adopted the general Canaanite language of the region .
what are the test scores on asvab
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery ( ASVAB ) is a multiple choice test , administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command , used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States armed forces .
It is often offered to American high school students when they are in the 10th , 11th and 12th grade , though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it .
Although the test is administered by the military , it is not ( and never has been ) a requirement that a test-taker with a qualifying score enlist in the armed forces .
what are corporation balance
In financial accounting , a balance sheet or statement of financial position is a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship , a business partnership , a corporation or other business organization , such as an LLC or an LLP .
Assets , liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date , such as the end of its financial year .
A balance sheet is often described as a `` snapshot of a company 's financial condition '' .
Of the four basic financial statements , the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business ' calendar year .
A standard company balance sheet has three parts : assets , liabilities and ownership equity .
The main categories of assets are usually listed first , and typically in order of liquidity .
Assets are followed by the liabilities .
The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation , net worth must equal assets minus liabilities .
Another way to look at the same equation is that assets equals liabilities plus owner 's equity .
Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed : either by borrowing money ( liability ) or by using the owner 's money ( owner 's equity ) .
Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections `` balancing . ''
A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period , plus any cash in hand .
However , many businesses are not paid immediately ; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment .
In other words : businesses have assets and so they can not , even if they want to , immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period .
Often , these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities , and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period .
In other words businesses also have liabilities .

what professional baseball pitchers were on the Schaumburg Flyers
The Schaumburg Flyers were a professional baseball team based in Schaumburg , Illinois , in the United States .
The Flyers were to be a charter member of the North American League , which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball , however , the team folded in March 2011 , before they began play in the NAL .
From the 1999 season to the 2010 season , the Flyers played their home games at Alexian Field , near the Elgin O'Hare Expressway .
The team formerly played in Thunder Bay , Ontario , where they were known as the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks .
The team was originally a member of the Northern League from 1993 to 2010 .
On July 27 , 2009 , the Flyers played host to Battle of the Sexes II , which pitted the Flyers against the National Pro Fastpitch Softball Champions , the Chicago Bandits .
Played by official softball rules , the game was seen by an overflow record crowd of 8,918 , and was won by the Bandits 4-2 .
In 1999 , the Flyers hired their first manager , Ron Kittle .
Kittle is best known for his playing days with the Chicago White Sox , and former Chicago Cubs and White Sox player Greg Hibbard was the pitching coach .
During the early years of the franchise , Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team , using the gimmick `` Ma Kittle . '' where he played both himself and his `` Ma . ''
The ads were successful at sparking some initial interest in the team as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars .
The ad mimicked the highly successful Converse ads where Larry Johnson starred as both himself and `` Gramama . ''
At the end of the 2001 season , however , Kittle resigned from his managerial position , and Jim Boynewicz was hired to replace him .
In 2004 , the Flyers made it to the Northern League Championship Series against the St. Paul Saints .
Despite leading the five-game series 2-1 , Schaumburg eventually lost the series .
In Game 5 , Flyers relief pitcher Lyle Prempas allowed a game winning grand slam by St. Paul infielder Marc Mirizzi in the ninth inning .
The Flyers appeared in the Northern League Playoffs four times ( 1999 , 2003 , 2004 , 2006 ) but never won the championship .
Some famous players who played for the Flyers were former Oakland A 's outfielder Ozzie Canseco and former Chicago Cubs outfielder Dwight Smith .

what made the civil war different from others
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .

what year was the 8 track invented
Stereo 8 , commonly known as the eight-track cartridge , eight-track tape , or simply eight-track , is a magnetic tape sound recording technology .
It was popular in the United States from the mid-1960s through to the early 1980s , but was relatively unknown in many European countries .
It was , however , very popular in the United Kingdom during this period .
Stereo 8 was created in 1964 by a consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation , along with Ampex , Ford Motor Company , General Motors , Motorola , and RCA Victor Records ( RCA ) .
It was a further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl `` Madman '' Muntz .

what leaves are in pharaoh ramses 2 mummy
Ramesses II ( 1303 BC – July or August 1213 BC ; Egyptian : , alternatively transcribed as Rameses and Ramses or ) , referred to as Ramesses the Great , was the third Egyptian pharaoh ( reigned 1279 BC – 1213 BC ) of the Nineteenth dynasty .
He is often regarded as the greatest , most celebrated , and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire .
His successors and later Egyptians called him the `` Great Ancestor . ''
Ramesses II led several military expeditions into the Levant , re-asserting Egyptian control over Canaan .
He also led expeditions to the south , into Nubia , commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el-Wali and Gerf Hussein .
At age fourteen , Ramesses was appointed Prince Regent by his father Seti I .
He is believed to have taken the throne in his late teens and is known to have ruled Egypt from 1279 BC to 1213 BC for 66 years and 2 months , according to both Manetho and Egypt 's contemporary historical records .
He was once said to have lived to be 99 years old , but it is more likely that he died in his 90th or 91st year .
If he became Pharaoh in 1279 BC as most Egyptologists today believe , he would have assumed the throne on May 31 , 1279 BC , based on his known accession date of III Shemu day 27 .
Ramesses II celebrated an unprecedented 14 sed festivals ( the first held after thirty years of a pharaoh 's reign , and then every three years ) during his reign—more than any other pharaoh .
On his death , he was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings ; his body was later moved to a royal cache where it was discovered in 1881 , and is now on display in the Cairo Museum .
The early part of his reign was focused on building cities , temples and monuments .
He established the city of Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta as his new capital and main base for his campaigns in Syria .
This city was built on the remains of the city of Avaris , the capital of the Hyksos when they took over , and was the location of the main Temple of Set .
He is also known as Ozymandias in the Greek sources , from a transliteration into Greek of a part of Ramesses 's throne name , , `` Ra 's mighty truth , chosen of Ra '' .

who killed julius caesar
Gaius Julius Caesar ( , July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC ) was a Roman general , statesman , Consul and notable author of Latin prose .
He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire .
In 60 BC , Caesar , Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate Roman politics for several years .
Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative elite within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero .
Caesar 's conquest of Gaul , completed by 51 BC , extended Rome 's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine .
Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain .
These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey , who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC .
With the Gallic Wars concluded , the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his military command and return to Rome .
Caesar refused , and marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with a legion , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman territory under arms .
Civil war resulted , from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of Rome .
After assuming control of government , Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms , including the creation of the Julian calendar .
He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed `` dictator in perpetuity '' .
But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved , and on the Ides of March ( 15 March ) 44 BC , Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus .
A new series of civil wars broke out , and the constitutional government of the Republic was never restored .
Caesar 's adopted heir Octavian , later known as Augustus , rose to sole power , and the era of the Roman Empire began .
Much of Caesar 's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns , and from other contemporary sources , mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust .
The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources .
Caesar is deemed to be one of the greatest military commanders of history .
what are the official languages of nigeria
Linguistic map of Nigeria , Cameroon , and Benin .
Sign in English , outside the University of Lagos
There are hundreds of languages spoken in Nigeria .
The major languages are Yoruba , Hausa , Igbo , Edo , Fulfulde , Kanuri , and Ibibio .
The official language of Nigeria , English , the former colonial language , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country .
English , however , remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite , and is not widely spoken in rural areas , which comprise three quarters of the countries population .
Nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of Africa as a whole , encompassing three major African languages families : Afroasiatic , Nilo-Saharan , and Niger–Congo .
Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages , such as Cen Tuum , which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families .

what part of the government is the federal court judge in ?
In the United States , the title of federal judge usually means a judge appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution .
In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals ( also called `` circuit courts '' ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts .
Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court , Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts .
All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as `` Article III judges '' because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III .
Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as `` federal judges '' ; however , they are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article I instead .
See Article I and Article III tribunals .

Who discovered the sense of touch ?
Touch is a crucial means of receiving information .
This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people .
The somatosensory system is a diverse sensory system comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the sensory modalities such as touch , temperature , proprioception ( body position ) , and nociception ( pain ) .
The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia , skeletal muscles , bones and joints , internal organs , and the cardiovascular system .
While touch is considered one of the five traditional senses , the impression of touch is formed from several modalities .
In medicine , the colloquial term `` touch '' is usually replaced with `` somatic senses '' to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved .
Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses , with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch , proprioception and ( depending on usage ) also haptic perception .
The system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors : thermoreceptors , nociceptors , mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors .
Transmission of information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and into the brain .
Processing primarily occurs in the primary somatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex .
The cortical homunculus was devised by Wilder Penfield .
At its simplest , the system works when activity in a sensory neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat ; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body—this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location .
The point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a homunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image .
This brain-surface ( `` cortical '' ) map is not immutable , however .
Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury .
what is a magnolias kingdom ?
Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae .
It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol .
Magnolia is an ancient genus .
Appearing before bees did , the flowers evolved to encourage pollination by beetles .
To avoid damage from pollinating beetles , the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough .
Fossilised specimens of Magnolia acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago , and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae dating to 95 million years ago .
Another aspect of Magnolias that is considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals ; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals .
Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea ( as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium ) .
The natural range of Magnolia species is a disjunct distribution , with a main centre in east and southeast Asia and a secondary centre in eastern North America , Central America , the West Indies , and some species in South America .
who wrote white christmas
thumb
`` White Christmas '' is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting .
According to the Guinness Book of World Records , the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time , with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide .
Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song .
One story is that he wrote it in 1940 , in warm La Quinta , California , while staying at the La Quinta Hotel , a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-producer Frank Capra , although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there .
He often stayed up all night writing — he told his secretary , `` Grab your pen and take down this song .
I just wrote the best song I 've ever written — heck , I just wrote the best song that anybody 's ever written ! ''

The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields , primarily Northern Europe , Canada , and Alaska .
Cross-country skiing is part of the Nordic skiing sport family , which includes ski jumping , Nordic combined ( cross-country skiing and ski jumping ) , Biathlon ( skiing and rifle marksmanship ) and ski-orienteering ( which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks ) .
Cross-country skiing is the modern style of skiing that most resembles prehistoric skiing , particularly when done in the backcountry .
It is also related to Telemark skiing .
what are use taxes ?
A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means , if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor , you owe use tax .
You must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered .
Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item ( without paying sales tax ) and store it in your warehouse initially , use tax applies to that location where goods were stored .
Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location , you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption .
This really means that you do n't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction .
It is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products/services .
If vendor does n't charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication .
Use Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is different .
Use tax is also termed as `` Consumption Tax '' or `` Consumer Use Tax '' .
A use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments .
It is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use , storage , or consumption in that state ( not for resale ) , regardless of where the purchase took place .
If a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state , full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction .
The use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home state 's sales tax .
Usually , this is due to out-of-state purchases , as well as ordering items through the mail , by phone , or over the Internet from other states .
The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed ( if any ) had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence .
For example , a resident of Massachusetts , with a 6.25 % `` sales and use tax '' on certain goods and services , purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use , storage or other consumption in Massachusetts .
Under New Hampshire law , the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods , but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax .
If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase , whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted ( as a tax credit ) from the 6.25 % owed for subsequent use , storage or consumption in Massachusetts .
With few exceptions , no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state , meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax .
The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods .
The assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually , but some states require a monthly payment .
For example , where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state , Vermont law requires filing a tax return ( Form SU-452 and payment ) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $ 50 late fee , a 5 % penalty per month , to a maximum of 25 % , plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties .
Typical exemptions include purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental agencies , purchases for resale in commerce , and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business .
Also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable .
As an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on `` pre-written '' ( not custom ) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts , regardless of where it originates .
However , the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service '' .
In contrast , Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet ( such as downloaded software or music ) , except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services '' .
Software ( pre-written or custom ) `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' ( i.e. , on disk ) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online , except `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable `` programming services '' even if delivered on a disk .
In most cases , this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location , remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them , if the company has a presence or `` nexus '' in every state ( as large `` brick-and-mortar '' sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do ) .
who pulmonary hypertension
In medicine , pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , and other symptoms , all of which are exacerbated by exertion .
Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
It was first identified by Dr. Ernst von Romberg in 1891 .
According to the most recent classification , it can be one of five different types : arterial , venous , hypoxic , thromboembolic or miscellaneous .
what are sanuks made of
right
right
Sanuk , a division of Deckers Outdoor Corporation , is a footwear brand based in Southern California .
Sanuk , the Thai word for fun , was founded by Southern California native Jeff Kelley when he started making sandals out of indoor-outdoor carpet .
The first product created was green carpeted and entitled the `` Fur Real '' after one shop owner asked if the novelty sandal was `` For Real . ''
The Fur Real first became a runaway hit through boutique stores and not the intended surf shops .
The novelty act was followed up by a sandal wrapped in wire mesh , a leopard print version , and styles made out of a poncho material in a variety of colors .
Sanuk has grown to include style options for men , women and youth and is distributed across the United States and in over 50 countries throughout Europe , Asia , South America and Australia .
Sanuk centers itself around a positive lifestyle advocating the slogan , `` Smile , Pass it on ! `` .
what is an array in programming
In computer science , array programming languages ( also known as vector or multidimensional languages ) generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors , matrices , and higher dimensional arrays .
Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation .
The level of conciseness can be dramatic in certain cases : it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more than a couple of pages of Java code .
APL , designed by Ken Iverson , was the first programming language to provide array programming capabilities .
The mnemonic APL refers to the title of his seminal book `` A Programming Language '' and not to arrays per se . Iverson 's contribution to rigor and clarity was probably more important than the simple extension of dimensions to functions .
what is a typical annuity premium
In the United States an annuity contract is created when an insured party , usually an individual , pays a life insurance company a single premium that will later be distributed back to the insured party over time .
Annuity contracts traditionally provide a guaranteed distribution of income over time , such as via fixed payments , until the death of the person or persons named in the contract or until a final date , whichever comes first .
However , the majority of modern annuity customers use annuities only to accumulate funds free of income and capital gains taxes and to later take lump-sum withdrawals without using the guaranteed-income-for-life feature .

Agency securities are usually exempt from state and local taxes , but not federal tax .
Agency debt is also called an agency security .
Who Discovered Nuclear Power
The Susquehanna Steam Electric Station , a boiling water reactor .
The reactors are located inside the rectangular containment buildings towards the front of the cooling towers .
Three nuclear-powered American warships , ( top to bottom ) nuclear cruisers USS Bainbridge and USS Long Beach with USS Enterprise the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in 1964 .
Crew members are spelling out Einstein 's mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2 on the flight deck .
The Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker NS Yamal on a 1994 joint expedition with the NSF .
Nuclear power is the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity .
Nuclear power plants provided about 5.7 % of the world 's energy and 13 % of the world 's electricity , in 2012 .
In 2013 , the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear power reactors ( although not all are producing electricity ) , in 31 countries .
In addition , there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation , powered by some 180 reactors .
There is an ongoing debate about the use of nuclear energy .
Proponents , such as the World Nuclear Association , the IAEA and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions .
Opponents , such as Greenpeace International and NIRS , believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment .
Nuclear power plant accidents include the Chernobyl disaster ( 1986 ) , Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ( 2011 ) , and the Three Mile Island accident ( 1979 ) .
There have also been some nuclear-powered submarine mishaps .
Research into safety improvements is continuing and nuclear fusion , believed to be safer , may be used in the future .
As of 2012 , according to the IAEA , worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries .
In the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60 years , and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration .
However , Japan 's 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster prompted a rethink of nuclear energy policy in many countries .
Germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022 , and Italy has banned nuclear power .
Following Fukushima , the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 .
when did the cold war start
Photograph of the Berlin Wall taken from the West side .
The Wall was built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing from Communism .
It was an iconic symbol of the Cold War and its fall in 1989 marked the end of the War .
The Cold War , often dated from 1947 to 1991 , was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States with NATO among its allies , and powers in the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union along with the Warsaw Pact .
This began after the success of their temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany , leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences .
A neutral faction arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt , India , and Yugoslavia ; this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East .
The Cold War was so named because the two major powers—each possessing nuclear weapons and thereby threatened with mutual assured destruction —never met in direct military combat .
Instead , in their struggle for global influence they engaged in ongoing psychological warfare and in regular indirect confrontations through proxy wars .
Cycles of relative calm would be followed by high tension , which could have led to world war .
The tensest times were during the Berlin Blockade ( 1948–1949 ) , the Korean War ( 1950–1953 ) , the Suez Crisis ( 1956 ) , the Berlin Crisis of 1961 , the Cuban missile crisis ( 1962 ) , the Vietnam War ( 1959–1975 ) , the Yom Kippur War ( 1973 ) , the Soviet war in Afghanistan ( 1979–1989 ) , the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ( 1983 ) , and the `` Able Archer '' NATO military exercises ( 1983 ) .
The conflict was expressed through military coalitions , strategic conventional force deployments , extensive aid to client states , espionage , massive propaganda campaigns , conventional and nuclear arms races , appeals to neutral nations , rivalry at sports events ( in particular the Olympics ) , and technological competitions such as the Space Race .
The US and USSR became involved in political and military conflicts in the Third World countries of Latin America , Africa , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia .
To alleviate the risk of a potential nuclear war , both sides sought relief of political tensions through détente in the 1970s .
In the 1980s , the United States increased diplomatic , military , and economic pressures on the Soviet Union , at a time when the communist state was already suffering from economic stagnation .
In the mid-1980s , the new Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika ( `` reorganization '' , 1987 ) and glasnost ( `` openness '' , ca . 1985 ) .
Pressures for national independence grew stronger in Eastern Europe , especially Poland .
They reached a breaking point when Gorbachev refused to use Soviet troops to support the faltering government of East Germany in late 1989 .
Within weeks all the satellite states broke free from Moscow in a peaceful wave of revolutions ( there was some violence in Romania ) .
The pressures escalated inside the Soviet Union , where Communism fell and the USSR was formally dissolved in late 1991 .
The United States remained as the world 's only superpower .
The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy , and it is often referred to in popular culture , especially in media featuring themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare .

when did talk radio begin in the U.S. ?
Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues .
Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests .
Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who `` call in '' ( usually via telephone ) to the show .
Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producer ( s ) in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , attract advertisers .
Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments .
Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk and sports talk .
While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts .
Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station .
In addition TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox are now often available expanding the world of talk radio further .
Talk radio listening is now enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as Tunein , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher .

who put the bible in verses
The Bible is a compilation of many shorter books written at different times and later assembled into the biblical canon .
All but the shortest of these books have been divided into chapters , generally a page or so in length , since the early 13th century .
Since the mid-16th century , each chapter has been further divided into `` verses '' of a few short lines or sentences .
Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse , as in the case of , and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse , as in the case of .
As the chapter and verse divisions were not part of the original texts , they form part of the paratext of the Bible .
The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians .
For instance , in Jewish tradition , the ascriptions to many Psalms are regarded as independent verses , making 116 more verses , whereas the established Christian practice is to count and number each Psalm ascription together with the first verse following it .
Some chapter divisions also occur in different places , e.g . in Hebrew Bibles is numbered as in Christian translations .
what is a book index
An index ( plural : indexes ) is a list of words or phrases ( 'headings ' ) and associated pointers ( 'locators ' ) to where useful material relating to that heading can be found in a document .

The pointers are typically page numbers , paragraph numbers or section numbers .
In a library catalog the words are authors , titles , subject headings , etc. , and the pointers are call numbers .
Internet search engines , such as Google , and full text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index , as they provide non-relevant links , and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect .

who created facebook
Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010
Facebook is an online social networking service , whose name stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other .
It was founded in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin , Andrew McCollum , Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes .
The website 's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students , but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area , the Ivy League , and Stanford University .
It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students , and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over .
Facebook now allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site .
Users must register before using the site , after which they may create a personal profile , add other users as friends , and exchange messages , including automatic notifications when they update their profile .
Additionally , users may join common-interest user groups , organized by workplace , school or college , or other characteristics , and categorize their friends into lists such as `` People From Work '' or `` Close Friends '' .
As of September 2012 , Facebook has over one billion active users .
According to a May 2011 Consumer Reports survey , there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts and 5 million under 10 , violating the site 's terms of service .
In May 2005 , Accel partners invested $ 12.7 million in Facebook , and Jim Breyer added $ 1 million of his own money to the pot .
A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users .
Entertainment Weekly included the site on its end-of-the-decade `` best-of '' list , saying , `` How on earth did we stalk our exes , remember our co-workers ' birthdays , bug our friends , and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook ? ''
Critics , such as Facebook Detox , state that Facebook has turned into a national obsession in the United States , resulting in vast amounts of time lost and encouraging narcissism .
Quantcast estimates Facebook has 138.9 million monthly unique U.S. visitors in May 2011 .
According to Social Media Today , in April 2010 an estimated 41.6 % ( 129.5 million ) of the U.S. population had a Facebook account .
Nevertheless , Facebook 's market growth started to stall in some regions , with the site losing 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011 .
Facebook eventually filed for an initial public offering on February 1 , 2012 , and was headquartered in Menlo Park , California .
Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ on May 18 , 2012 .
what are the sulfas
Sulfonamide functional group
Hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide and a thiazide .
Furosemide is a sulfonamide , but not a thiazide .
Sulfonamide or sulphonamide is the basis of several groups of drugs .
The original antibacterial sulfonamides ( sometimes called sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs ) are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain the sulfonamide group .
Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity , e.g. , the anticonvulsant sultiame .
The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based on the antibacterial sulfonamides .
Sulfa allergies are common , hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully .
It is important to make a distinction between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives , such as sulfates and sulfites , which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group , and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides .

New York City Cruise Liner Terminal in Hell 's Kitchen at 52nd Street .
The New York Passenger Ship Terminal ( also known as the Luxury Liner Row or Manhattan Cruise Terminal or New York Cruise Terminal ) is a terminal for ocean-going passenger ships on Manhattan 's west side .
The terminal consists of North River Piers 88 , 90 , 92 and 94 on the Hudson River between West 46th and West 54th Street .
( As a general rule , pier numbers in Manhattan can be determined by adding 40 to the corresponding cross-street . )
Ships now dock at Piers 88 , 90 and 92 .
Pier 94 on the north side is now used for exhibition space .
Pier 86 , once used by United States Lines , is now home to the USS Intrepid .
In 2003 , the terminal handled 900,000 passengers .
The city is forecasting that 1.5 million will use the terminal by 2017 .
The piers are long and apart .
They were first completed in 1935 to replace the Chelsea Piers as the city 's luxury liner terminal .
The new terminal was built to handle bigger ships that had outgrown the Chelsea Piers .
The piers were renovated in 1970 and are currently undergoing another $ 150 million renovation .
The renovated plans call for it to handle three large ships at a time .
In doing renovations , the city is also considering decommissioning Pier 92 .

decades the terminal was the only ocean-going passenger terminal in New York harbor .
With an upsurge in cruise ship traffic and the terminal 's ability to handle comfortably only three large ships at a time , two new terminals have opened in the harbor — the Cape Liberty Cruise Port opened in 2004 in Bayonne , New Jersey ( used by Royal Caribbean Cruise Line , Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises ) , and the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal ( used by the Queen Mary 2 and other ships of the Carnival Corporation cruise brands ) opened in 2006 in Brooklyn , New York .
The West Side Highway takes a small jog east from the piers to below West 42nd Street because when the terminal was built land had to be taken away from Manhattan to allow for longer piers .
The US Army Corps of Engineers , who control the waterfront dimension , would not extend the pierhead line farther into the river , so the city extended the pier by cutting away at the land .
The city earlier did this for the Chelsea Piers ; however in Chelsea only landfill was taken away .
At the Passenger Terminal actual Manhattan schist was taken away .
From downstream in the river
Many major passenger ships have docked there , including the RMS Queen Mary 2 and Freedom of the Seas , before the Brooklyn and Bayonne terminals opened .
The SS Normandie caught fire and subsequently capsized at its Pier 88 berth during World War II .
The Normandie , renamed USS Lafayette , lies capsized in the frozen mud at Pier 88 in the winter of 1942
Norwegian Cruise Line 's soon to be newest ship the Norwegian Breakaway will sail year-round out of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal .
The city will spend $ 4 million to renovate and upgrade the cruise terminal to accommodate the ship .

what is a right wing christian
Christian right is a term used in the United States to describe right-wing Christian political groups that are characterized by their strong support of socially conservative policies .
Christian conservatives principally seek to apply their understanding of the teachings of Christianity to politics and public policy by proclaiming the value of those teachings and/or by seeking to use those teachings to influence law and public policy .
In the U.S. , the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of evangelical Protestants that draws `` support from politically conservative Catholics , Jews , Mormons , and occasionally secularists '' who share their goals .
The movement has its roots in American politics going back as far the 1940s and has been especially influential since the 1970s .
Their influence draws , in part , from grassroots activism as well as their focus on social issues and ability to motivate the electorate around those issues .
The Christian right is notable today for advancing socially conservative positions on issues including school prayer , stem cell research , homosexuality , contraception , abortion , and pornography .
Although the Christian right is usually associated with the U.S. , the movement has been a key factor in the politics of Canada , The Netherlands , Northern Ireland and Australia , among others .
when did they establish the song rocketeer

where did hurricane katrina begin
Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest and most destructive Atlantic hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season .
It was the costliest natural disaster , as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes , in the history of the United States .
Among recorded Atlantic hurricanes , it was the sixth strongest overall .
At least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods , making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane ; total property damage was estimated at $ 81 billion ( 2005 USD ) , nearly triple the damage brought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 .
Hurricane Katrina formed over the Bahamas on August 23 , 2005 and crossed southern Florida as a moderate Category 1 hurricane , causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico .
The hurricane strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane over the warm Gulf water , but weakened before making its second landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on the morning of Monday , August 29 in southeast Louisiana .
It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas , much of it due to the storm surge .
The most significant number of deaths occurred in New Orleans , Louisiana , which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed , in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland .
Eventually 80 % of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded , and the floodwaters lingered for weeks .
However , the worst property damage occurred in coastal areas , such as all Mississippi beachfront towns , which were flooded over 90 % in hours , as boats and casino barges rammed buildings , pushing cars and houses inland , with waters reaching 6–12 miles ( 10–19 km ) from the beach .
The hurricane surge protection failures in New Orleans are considered the worst civil engineering disaster in U.S. history and prompted a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) , the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the Flood Control Act of 1965 .
Responsibility for the failures and flooding was laid squarely on the Army Corps in January 2008 by Judge Stanwood Duval , U.S. District Court , but the federal agency could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 .
There was also an investigation of the responses from federal , state and local governments , resulting in the resignation of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown , and of New Orleans Police Department ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass .
Several agencies including the United States Coast Guard ( USCG ) , National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) , and National Weather Service ( NWS ) were commended for their actions .
They provided accurate hurricane weather tracking forecasts with sufficient lead time .
Even the most insistent appeals from national , state and local public officials to residents to evacuate before the storm did not warn that the levees could breach and fail .
who owns us treasuries
U.S. debt from 1940 to 2011 .
Red lines indicate the `` debt held by the public '' and black lines indicate the total national debt or gross public debt .
The difference is the `` intragovernmental debt , '' which includes obligations to government programs such as Social Security .
Stated as a formula , National Debt = Debt held by the Public + Intragovernmental Debt .
The second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of U.S. GDP ( dollar value of U.S. economic production for that year ) .
The top panel is deflated so every year is in 2010 dollars .
The United States public debt is the money borrowed by the federal government of the United States through the issuing of securities by the Treasury and other federal government agencies .
US public debt consists of two components:
Debt held by the public includes Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government , including that held by individuals , corporations , the Federal Reserve System and foreign , state and local governments .
Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt includes non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries , such as the Social Security Trust Fund .
Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses , including interest earnings , of these accounts that have been invested in Treasury securities .
Public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual unified budget deficit or surplus .
The federal government budget deficit or surplus is the difference between government receipts and spending , ignoring intra-governmental transfers .
However , some spending that is excluded from the deficit ( supplemental appropriations ) also adds to the debt .
Historically , the US public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions , and subsequently declined .
For example , debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II ( 113 % of GDP in 1945 ) , but then fell over the following 30 years .
In recent decades , however , large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government 's fiscal policies .
On 2 April 2013 , debt held by the public was approximately $ 11.959 trillion or about 75 % of GDP .
Intragovernmental holdings stood at $ 4.846 trillion , giving a combined total public debt of $ 16.805 trillion .
As of January 2013 , $ 5.6 trillion or approximately 47 % of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors , the largest of which were the People 's Republic of China and Japan at just over $ 1.1 trillion each .
what is an assist in basketball
In basketball , an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal , meaning that he or she was `` assisting '' in the basket .
There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist .
An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball .
However , the original definition of an assist did not include such situations , so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter .
Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist , so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal ( unlike in other sports , such as ice hockey ) .
A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA , but does in FIBA play ( only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made ) .
Point guards tend to get the most assists per game ( apg ) , as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler .
Centers tend to get fewer assists , but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting .
Being inside the key , the center often has the best angles and the best position for `` dishes '' and other short passes in the scoring area .
Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in assists in 1968 .
A strong center with inside-scoring prowess , such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon , can also be an effective assistor because the defense 's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters .
The NBA single-game assist record is 30 , held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic against the Denver Nuggets , on December 30 , 1990 .
The NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton with 15,806 .
what is 1 mil guaranies in united states dollars
The mill or mille ( ) ( sometimes mil in the UK , when discussing property taxes in the United States , or previously in Cyprus and Malta ) is a now-abstract unit of currency used sometimes in accounting .
In the United States , it is a notional unit equivalent to of a United States dollar ( a tenth of a cent ) .
In the United Kingdom it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the decimalization of the pound as a division of the pound sterling .
Several other currencies used the mill , such as the Maltese lira .
The term comes from the Latin `` millesimum '' , meaning `` thousandth part '' .
where did the persian war take place
The Greco-Persian Wars ( also often called the Persian Wars ) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and city-states of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC .
The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC .
Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia , the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them .
This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike .
In 499 BC , the then tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos , with Persian support ; however , the expedition was a debacle and , pre-empting his dismissal , Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians .
This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt , which would last until 493 BC , progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict .
Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria , and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis .
The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act .
The revolt continued , with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC .
In 494 BC , the Persians regrouped , and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus .
At the Battle of Lade , the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat , and the rebellion collapsed , with the final members being stamped out the following year .
Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks , Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for burning Sardis .
The first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC , with the Persian general Mardonius conquering Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign .
In 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece , this time across the Aegean Sea , under the command of Datis and Artaphernes .
This expedition subjugated the Cyclades , before besieging , capturing and razing Eretria .
However , while en route to attack Athens , the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon , ending Persian efforts for the time being .
Darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of Greece , but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes I .
In 480 BC , Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled .
Victory over the 'Allied ' Greek states ( led by Sparta and Athens ) at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun most of Greece .
However , while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet , the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis .
The following year , the confederated Greeks went on the offensive , defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea , and ending the invasion of Greece .
The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale , before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos ( 479 BC ) and Byzantium ( 478 BC ) .
The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans , and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership , as the so-called Delian League .
The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades , beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe .
At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC , the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia .
However , the League 's involvement in an Egyptian revolt ( from 460–454 BC ) resulted in a disastrous defeat , and further campaigning was suspended .
A fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC , but achieved little , and when it withdrew the Greco-Persian Wars drew to a quiet end .
Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia , the so-called Peace of Callias .

where does matt hasselbeck live
Matthew Michael Hasselbeck ( born September 25 , 1975 ) is an American football quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
He was drafted in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers .
After a season on the practice squad and two seasons backing up Brett Favre , he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in 2001 .
Hasselbeck gained the starting role in 2003 , and led Seattle to six playoff appearances and a Super Bowl appearance ; he was selected to three Pro Bowls and an All-Pro selection .
Following ten seasons with the Seahawks , Hasselbeck joined the Tennessee Titans in 2011 .
Hasselbeck then signed a contract with the Indianapolis Colts in 2013 less than 24 hours after being released by the Tennessee Titans .
what are the impacts of information communication technology to public relation practices
ICT is inevitably related to the computer network .
Information and Communications Technology or ( ICT ) , is often used as an extended synonym for information technology ( IT ) , but is a more specific term that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications ( telephone lines and wireless signals ) , computers as well as necessary enterprise software , middleware , storage , and audio-visual systems , which enable users to access , store , transmit , and manipulate information .
The phrase ICT had been used by academic researchers since the 1980s , but it became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in 1997 and in the revised National Curriculum for England , Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000 .
The term ICT is now also used to refer to the convergence of audio-visual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system .
There are large economic incentives ( huge cost savings due to elimination of the telephone network ) to merge the audio-visual , building management and telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling , signal distribution and management .
The term Infocommunications is used in some cases as a shorter form of information and communication ( s ) technology .
In fact Infocommunications is the expansion of telecommunications with information processing and content handling functions on a common digital technology base .

when did thomson make the plum-pudding model
A schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom ; in Thomson 's mathematical model the `` corpuscles '' ( or modern electrons ) were arranged non-randomly , in rotating rings
The current model of the sub-atomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons
The plum pudding model of the atom by J. J. Thomson , who discovered the electron in 1897 , was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model .
In this model , the atom is composed of electrons ( which Thomson still called `` corpuscles '' , though G. J. Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 ) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons ' negative charges , like negatively charged `` plums `` surrounded by positively charged `` pudding `` .
The electrons ( as we know them today ) were thought to be positioned throughout the atom , but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons , particularly rotating rings of electrons ( see below ) .
Instead of a soup , the atom was also sometimes said to have had a `` cloud '' of positive charge .
With this model , Thomson abandoned his earlier `` nebular atom '' hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vortices .
Now , at least part of the atom was to be composed of Thomson 's particulate negative corpuscles , although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined .
The 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden .
This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911
to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge ( in the case of gold , enough to balance about 100 electrons ) , thus leading to the Rutherford model of the atom .
Although gold has an atomic number of 79 , immediately after Rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den Broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear charge .
The matter required experiment to decide .
Henry Moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 ( see Moseley 's law ) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number ( Moseley found only one unit difference ) , and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and Rutherford .
This work culminated in the solar-system-like ( but quantum-limited ) Bohr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells .
Bohr had also inspired Moseley 's work .
Thomson 's model was compared ( though not by Thomson ) to a British dessert called plum pudding , hence the name .
Thomson 's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine , the leading British science journal of the day .
In Thomson 's view : ... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , ...
In this model , the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance .
These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud , it felt a larger net positive inward force , because there was more material of opposite charge , inside its orbit ( see Gauss 's law ) .
In Thomson 's model , electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons , and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits .
Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements , but was not notably successful at this .
Still , Thomson 's model ( along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn 's rings ) , were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom .
what part of the pig is bacon
Typical strip of bacon .
Bacon is a cured meat prepared from a pig .
It is first cured using large quantities of salt , either in a brine or in a dry packing ; the result is fresh bacon ( also known as green bacon ) .
Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air , or it may be boiled or smoked .
Fresh and dried bacon is typically cooked before eating .
Boiled bacon is ready to eat , as is some smoked bacon , but may be cooked further before eating .
Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat .
It is usually made from side and back cuts of pork , except in the United States , where it is almost always prepared from pork belly ( typically referred to as `` streaky '' , `` fatty '' , or `` American style '' outside of the US and Canada ) .
The side cut has more meat and less fat than the belly .
Bacon may be prepared from either of two distinct back cuts : fatback , which is almost pure fat , and pork loin , which is very lean .
Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon .
Uncooked pork belly bacon strips .
Bacon may be eaten smoked , boiled , fried , baked , or grilled , or used as a minor ingredient to flavor dishes .
Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts , especially game , e.g . venison , pheasant .
The word is derived from the Old High German bacho , meaning `` buttock '' , `` ham '' or `` side of bacon '' , and cognate with the Old French bacon .
In continental Europe , this part of the pig is usually not smoked like bacon is in the United States ; it is used primarily in cubes ( lardons ) as a cooking ingredient , valued both as a source of fat and for its flavor .
In Italy , this is called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or served uncooked and thinly sliced as part of an antipasto .
Meat from other animals , such as beef , lamb , chicken , goat , or turkey , may also be cut , cured , or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon , and may even be referred to as `` bacon '' .
Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations .
The USDA defines bacon as `` the cured belly of a swine carcass '' ; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified ( e.g. , `` smoked pork loin bacon '' ) .
For safety , bacon must be treated to prevent trichinosis , caused by Trichinella , a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating , freezing , drying , or smoking .
Bacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine ( or dry packing ) .
Bacon brine has added curing ingredients , most notably sodium nitrite , and occasionally sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate ( saltpeter ) ; sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilize color .
Flavorings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products .
If used , sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan fried .
Today , a brine for ham , but not bacon , includes a large amount of sugar .
Historically , `` ham '' and `` bacon '' referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically , often together in the same barrel .
where did erisa come from
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) ( , codified in part at ) is a federal law which establishes minimum standards for pension plans in private industry and provides for extensive rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans .
ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by:
Requiring the disclosure of financial and other information concerning the plan to beneficiaries ;
Establishing standards of conduct for plan fiduciaries ;
Providing for appropriate remedies and access to the federal courts .
ERISA is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws regulating employee benefit plans , which are found mainly in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA itself .
Responsibility for the interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor , the Department of the Treasury ( particularly the Internal Revenue Service ) , and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation .
what percent of illegal immigrants are from mexico and europe
Illegal immigration to the United States is the act of foreign nationals entering the United States , without government permission and in violation of United States nationality law , or staying beyond the termination date of a visa , also in violation of the law .
A warning sign at the international boundary between the United States and Canada in Point Roberts , Washington .
A much different approach at the U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso , Texas
The undocumented immigrant population of the United States in 2008 was estimated by the Center for Immigration Studies to be about 11 million people , down from 12.5 million people in 2007 .
Other estimates range from 7 to 20 million .
According to a 2005 Pew Hispanic Center report , 56 % of undocumented immigrants were from Mexico ; 22 % were from other Latin American countries ; 13 % were from Asia ; 6 % were from Europe and Canada ; and 3 % were from Africa and the rest of the world .

what nerves run through the humerus
In human anatomy , the ulnar nerve is a nerve which runs near the ulna bone .
The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve .
The nerve is the largest unprotected nerve in the human body ( meaning unprotected by muscle or bone ) , so injury is common .
This nerve is directly connected to the little finger , and the adjacent half of the ring finger , supplying the palmar side of these fingers , including both front and back of the tips , perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds .
One method of injuring the nerve is to strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly , or inferiorly with the elbow flexed .
The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point .
This is commonly referred to as bumping one 's `` funny bone '' .
This name is thought to be a pun , based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm , the `` humerus `` and the word `` humorous `` .
Alternatively , according to the Oxford English Dictionary it may refer to `` the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck '' .
what are the houses of hogwarts
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , shortened Hogwarts , is a fictional British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen , and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series .
Rowling has suggested that she may have inadvertently taken the name from the hogwort plant ( Croton capitatus ) , which she had seen at Kew Gardens some time before writing the series , although the names `` The Hogwarts '' and `` Hoggwart '' appear in the 1954 Nigel Molesworth book How To Be Topp by Geoffrey Willans .
Hogwarts school was voted as the 36th best Scottish educational establishment in a 2008 online ranking , outranking Edinburgh 's Loretto School .
According to a director of the Independent Schools Network Rankings , it was added to the schools listing `` for fun '' and was then voted on .
when us subprime mortgage market collapse
The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008 .
It was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures , and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgages .
Several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008 , with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession .
There were many causes of the crisis , with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions , regulators , credit agencies , government housing policies , and consumers , among others .
A proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending .
The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8 % or lower range to approximately 20 % from 2004 to 2006 , with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S .
A high percentage of these subprime mortgages , over 90 % in 2006 for example , were adjustable-rate mortgages .
These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products .
Further , U.S. households had become increasingly indebted , with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77 % in 1990 to 127 % at the end of 2007 , much of this increase mortgage-related .
When U.S. home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid-2006 , borrowers ' ability to refinance their loans became more difficult .
As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates ( causing higher monthly payments ) , mortgage delinquencies soared .
Securities backed with mortgages , including subprime mortgages , widely held by financial firms globally , lost most of their value .
Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending .
Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe .
The crisis had severe , long-lasting consequences for the U.S. and European economies .
The U.S. entered a deep recession , with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 , roughly 6 % of the workforce .
U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30 % on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50 % by early 2009 .
As of early 2013 , the U.S. stock market had recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated .
Economic growth remained below pre-crisis levels .
Europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis .
What kind of personality test is the MBTI
Carl Jung in 1910 .
Myers and Briggs extrapolated their MBTI theory from Jung 's writings in his book Psychological Types .
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions .
These preferences were extrapolated from the typological theories proposed by Carl Gustav Jung and first published in his 1921 book Psychological Types ( English edition , 1923 ) .
Jung theorized that there are four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world : sensation , intuition , feeling , and thinking .
One of these four functions is dominant most of the time .
The original developers of the personality inventory were Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter , Isabel Briggs Myers ; these two , having studied extensively the work of Jung , turned their interest of human behavior into a devotion of turning the theory of psychological types to practical use .
They began creating the indicator during World War II , believing that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would be `` most comfortable and effective '' .
The initial questionnaire grew into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator , which was first published in 1962 .
The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences .
Robert Kaplan and Dennis Saccuzzo believe `` the underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences , and these preferences underlie our interests , needs , values , and motivation '' ( p. 499 ) .
who plays judas in lady gaga video judas ?
`` Judas '' is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga , from her second studio album Born This Way ( 2011 ) .
It was released by Interscope Records on April 15 , 2011 , four days ahead of its scheduled release .
Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne , `` Judas '' is a dance and electro house song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her .
It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past , and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she ca n't escape .
Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one 's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light .
The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word .
In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups , the song was generally well received by critics , who likened the song to `` Bad Romance `` with some noting it should have been the album 's lead single .
The song has a similar sound to Gaga 's previous RedOne-produced tracks , including `` Poker Face `` , `` LoveGame `` , `` Bad Romance '' , and `` Alejandro `` .
It contains three distinct hooks and a house -influenced break down .
Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption , regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be .
`` Judas '' initially had a strong sales opening , but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga 's previous singles .
The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets , and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea .
A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011 , co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus .
It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene .
The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem .
It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus , and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death .
Before its release , the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the alleged use of religious imagery and her role in the video .
However , critics generally praised the video , not finding any offensive content .
The video was nominated for two awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards .
Gaga has performed `` Judas '' on a number of television shows , including The Graham Norton Show , Saturday Night Live , Good Morning Americas `` Summer Concert Series '' , the French X Factor as well as on The Ellen DeGeneres Show .

when does the electoral college votes
Electoral College map showing the results of the 2012 U.S. presidential election .
President Barack Obama ( D - IL ) won the popular vote in 26 states and the District of Columbia ( denoted in blue ) to capture 332 electoral votes .
Former Governor Mitt Romney ( R - MA ) won the popular vote in 24 states ( denoted in red ) to capture 206 electoral votes .
Cartogram representation of the Electoral College vote for the 2012 election , with each square representing one electoral vote .
The United States Electoral College is the institution that officially elects the President and Vice President of the United States every four years .
The President and Vice President are not elected directly by the voters .
Instead , they are elected by `` electors '' who are chosen by popular vote on a state-by-state basis .
Electors are apportioned to each state and the District of Columbia , but not to territorial possessions of the United States , such as Puerto Rico and Guam .
The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of Congress to which the state is entitled .
The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors .
There are 538 electors , based on there being 435 representatives and 100 senators , plus the three electors from the District of Columbia .
Electors are pledged to particular presidential and vice presidential candidates , though unpledged electors are possible .
In all states , except Maine and Nebraska , electors are elected on a `` winner-take-all '' basis .
That is , all electors pledged to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes in a state become electors for that state .
Maine and Nebraska use the `` congressional district method '' , selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote .
Although no elector is required by federal law to honor a pledge , there have only been very few occasions when an elector voted contrary to a pledge .
The Twelfth Amendment specifies how a President and Vice President are elected and requires each elector to cast one vote for President and another vote for Vice President .
Critics argue that the Electoral College is inherently undemocratic and gives swing states disproportionate influence in electing the President and Vice President .
The Electoral College gives a numeric advantage in the election of the president to the smaller states , as the minimum number of electors for the small states is three compared to one for the election of representatives .
On the other hand , the winner-take-all method of voting favors the larger states .
A number of constitutional amendments have been proposed seeking to alter the Electoral College or replace it with a direct popular vote .

Nine months later , Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate .
He was re-elected president in November 2012 , defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney , and was sworn in for a second term on January 20 , 2013 .
Early in his first term in office , Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief , Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization , and Job Creation Act of 2010 .
Other major domestic initiatives in his presidency include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , often referred to as `` Obamacare '' ; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ; the Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 ; the Budget Control Act of 2011 ; and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 .
In May 2012 , he became the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage and in 2013 his administration filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in two high-profile cases .
In foreign policy , Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War , increased troop levels in Afghanistan , signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia , ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya , and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden .

where does apple operate
iOS ( previously iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system developed and distributed by Apple Inc . Originally released in 2007 for the iPhone and iPod Touch platforms , it has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPad and Apple TV .
Unlike Microsoft 's Windows Phone and Google 's Android , Apple does not license iOS for installation on non-Apple hardware .
, Apple 's App Store contained more than 700,000 iOS applications , which have collectively been downloaded more than 30 billion times .
It had a 21 % share of the smartphone mobile operating system units shipped in the fourth quarter of 2012 , behind only Google 's Android .
In June 2012 , it accounted for 65 % of mobile web data consumption ( including use on both the iPod Touch and the iPad ) .
At the half of 2012 , there were 410 million devices activated .
According to the special media event held by Apple on September 12 , 2012 , 400 million devices have been sold through June 2012 .
The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures .
Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons .
Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface .
Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode ) .
iOS is derived from OS X , with which it shares the Darwin foundation .
iOS is Apple 's mobile version of the OS X operating system used on Apple computers .
In iOS , there are four abstraction layers : the Core OS layer , the Core Services layer , the Media layer , and the Cocoa Touch layer .
The current version of the operating system ( iOS 6.1.3 ) dedicates 1-1.5 GB of the device 's flash memory for the system partition , using roughly 800 MB of that partition ( varying by model ) for iOS itself .
iOS currently runs on iPhone , iPad , iPod touch and Apple TV .
what are spoilers for
The Plymouth Superbird is famous for its extremely high rear wing .
1987 Audi Sport QuattroS1 with its large wings at Pikes Peak
A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil ' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion , usually described as turbulence or drag .
Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams , because in addition to directing air flow they also reduce the amount of air flowing underneath the vehicle which generally reduces aerodynamic lift and drag .
Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars , although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well .
Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse .
Spoilers for cars are often incorrectly confused with , or the term used interchangeably with , wings .
Automotive wings are devices whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around them , not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns .

A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination and steps of Gavrilo Princip ( image taken in 1987 , before steps were removed in 1992 and plaque changed from Cyrillic to Latin script )
A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination ( image taken in 2009 )
On 28 June 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne , and his wife , Sophie , Duchess of Hohenberg , were shot dead in Sarajevo , by Gavrilo Princip , one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić .
The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary 's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia .
The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia .
Serbian military officers stood behind the attack .
At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić , and Masterspy Rade Malobabić .
Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them .
The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary .
The assassins , the key members of the clandestine tunnel , and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested , tried , convicted and punished .
Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914 .
The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges ; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators .
Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records .
Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later .
who build the san juan capistrano mission
Mission San Juan Capistrano was a Spanish mission in Southern California , located in present-day San Juan Capistrano .
It was founded on All Saints ' Day November 1 , 1776 , by Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order .
Named for Giovanni da Capistrano , a 15th century theologian and `` warrior priest '' who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy , San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use , a chapel built in 1782 .
Known alternately as `` Serra 's Chapel '' and `` Father Serra 's Church , '' it is the only extant structure where it has been documented that the padre Junipero Serra celebrated mass .
One of the best known of the Alta California missions ( and one of the few missions to have actually been founded twice—others being Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission La Purísima Concepción ) .
The site was originally consecrated on October 30 , 1775 , by Father Fermín Lasuén , but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego .
The success of the settlement is evident in its historical records .
Prior to the arrival of the missionaries , some 550 natives were scattered throughout the local area .
By 1790 , the number of converted Christians had grown to 700 , and just six years later nearly 1,000 `` neophytes `` ( recent converts ) lived in or around the Mission compound .
1,649 baptisms were conducted that year alone , out of the total 4,639 souls converted between 1776 and 1847 .
More than 2,000 former inhabitants ( mostly Juaneño Indians ) are buried in unmarked graves in the Mission 's cemetery ( campo santo ) .
The remains of Father ( later Monsignor ) St. John O'Sullivan , who recognized the property 's historic value and working tirelessly to conserve and rebuild its structures , are buried at the entrance to the cemetery on the west side of the property , and a statue raised in his honor stands at the head of the crypt .
The surviving chapel also serves as the final resting place of three padres who passed on while serving at the Mission : Fathers José Barona , Vicente Fustér , and Vicente Pascual Oliva are all entombed beneath the sanctuary floor .
The Criolla or `` Mission grape , '' was first planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779 ; in 1783 , the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from the Mission 's winery .
The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after secularization in 1833 .
Numerous efforts were made over the years to restore the Mission to its former glory , but none met with great success until the arrival of Father O'Sullivan in 1910 .
Restoration efforts continue , and `` Serra 's Chapel '' is still used for religious services .
About half-a-million visitors , including 80,000 school children , come to the Mission each year .
And while the ruins of `` The Great Stone Church '' ( which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake ) are a renowned architectural wonder , the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual `` Return of the Swallows '' which is traditionally observed every March 19 ( Saint Joseph 's Day ) .
Mission San Juan Capistrano has served as a favorite subject for many notable artists , and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times , perhaps more than any other mission .
In 1984 , a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound and is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano .
Today , the mission compound serves as a museum , with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish .

Mercedes-Benz Superdome ( originally Louisiana Superdome and commonly The Superdome ) is a sports and exhibition stadium , located in the Central Business District of New Orleans , Louisiana , USA .
Plans were drawn up in 1967 , by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis .

Because of the size and location in one of the major tourist destinations in the United States , the Superdome routinely makes the `` short list '' of candidates being considered for major sporting events , such as the Super Bowl and the Final Four .
In 2005 , the Superdome gained international attention of a different type when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina .
The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm , and was closed for many months afterward .
On October 3 , 2011 , it was announced that German automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium .
The new name took effect on October 23 , 2011 .
It is the third stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz ( and first in the United States ) , after the Mercedes-Benz Arena , the stadium of Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart , in Stuttgart , Germany and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai , China .

The People 's Party , also known as the `` Populists '' , was a short-lived political party in the United States established in 1891 during the Populist movement ( United States , 19th Century ) .
It was most important in 1892-96 , and then rapidly faded away .
Based among poor , white cotton farmers in the South ( especially North Carolina , Alabama , and Texas ) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the plains states ( especially Kansas and Nebraska ) , it represented a radical crusading form of agrarianism and hostility to banks , railroads , and elites generally .
It sometimes formed coalitions with labor unions , and in 1896 the Democrats endorsed their presidential nominee , William Jennings Bryan .
The terms `` populist '' and `` populism `` are commonly used for anti-elitist appeals in opposition to established interests and mainstream parties .
what are two languages in Nigeria ?
Linguistic map of Nigeria , Cameroon , and Benin .
Sign in English , outside the University of Lagos
There are hundreds of languages spoken in Nigeria .
The major languages are Yoruba , Hausa , Igbo , Edo , Fulfulde , Kanuri , and Ibibio .
The official language of Nigeria , English , the former colonial language , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country .
English , however , remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite , and is not widely spoken in rural areas , which comprise three quarters of the countries population .
Nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of Africa as a whole , encompassing three major African languages families : Afroasiatic , Nilo-Saharan , and Niger–Congo .
Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages , such as Cen Tuum , which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families .
what war led to Pearl Harbor
A series of events led to the attack on Pearl Harbor .
War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation 's military forces planned for since the 1920s , though real tension did not begin until the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by Japan .
Over the next decade , Japan expanded slowly into China , leading to all out war between the two in 1937 .
In 1940 Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to embargo all imports into China , including war supplies purchased from the U.S .
This move prompted the United States to embargo all oil exports , leading the Imperial Japanese Navy to estimate that it had less than two years of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies .
Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the `` Southern Resource Area '' to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that Japan envisioned in the Pacific .
The Philippine islands , at that time an American territory , were also a Japanese target .
The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response .
Rather than seize and fortify the islands , and wait for the inevitable US counterattack , Japan 's military leaders instead decided on the pre-emptive Pearl Harbor attack , which they assumed would negate the American forces needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands .
Planning for the attack had begun in very early 1941 , by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto .
He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by , among other things , threatening to resign .
The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall .
Simultaneously over the year , pilots were trained , and ships prepared for its execution .
Authority for the attack was granted at the second Imperial Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was not reached .
After final approval by Emperor Hirohito the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December .
what are the thing in a stapler ?
A common office stapler
A common school stapler
A stapler is a mechanical device that joins sheets of paper or similar material by driving a thin metal staple through the sheets and folding the ends .
Staplers are widely used in government , business , offices , homes and schools .
The word `` stapler '' can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses .
In addition to joining paper sheets together , staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together with surgical staples to close a surgical wound ( much in the same way as stitches or sutures ) .
Typically , most staplers are used to join multiple sheets of paper .
Paper staplers come in two distinct types : manual and electric .
Manual staplers are normally hand-held , although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon .
Electric staplers exist in a variety of different designs and models .
Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession .
Some electric staplers can join up to 20 sheets at a time .
what types of muscles are those of the swallowing mechanism ?
Swallowing , known scientifically as deglutition , is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth , to the pharynx , and into the esophagus , while shutting the epiglottis .
If this fails and the object goes through the trachea , then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur .
In the human body it is controlled by the swallowing reflex .
what race was Thaddeus Stevens
Thaddeus Stevens ( April 4 , 1792 – August 11 , 1868 ) , of Pennsylvania , was a leader of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party and a fierce opponent of slavery .
He was one of the most influential members in the history of Congress .
As chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee , Stevens , a witty , sarcastic speaker and flamboyant party leader , dominated the House from 1861 until his death .
He wrote much of the financial legislation that paid for the American Civil War .
Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner were the prime leaders of the Radical Republicans during the war and Reconstruction era .
Scholarly views of Stevens have swung sharply since his death as interpretations of Reconstruction have changed .
Historians of the Dunning School ( 1890s–1940s ) held Stevens responsible for demanding harsh treatment of the white South and violating American traditions of republicanism , depicting Stevens as a villain for his advocacy of harsh measures in the South such as disfranchising all ex-Confederates .
This highly negative characterization held sway into the 1950s .
The rise of the neo-abolitionist school in the 1950s led to a strong positive appreciation of Stevens ' work on civil rights for Freedmen .
A recent biographer characterizes him as , `` The Great Commoner , savior of free public education in Pennsylvania , national Republican leader in the struggles against slavery in the United States and intrepid mainstay of the attempt to secure racial justice for the Freedmen during Reconstruction , the only member of the House of Representatives ever to have been known as the 'dictator ' of Congress .

where translation on DNA happens
Overview of the translation of eukaryotic messenger RNA
Diagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome
In molecular biology and genetics , translation is the process through which cellular ribosomes manufacture proteins .
It is part of the process of gene expression .
In translation , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain , or polypeptide , that will later fold into an active protein .
In bacteria , translation occurs in the cell 's cytoplasm , where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located , and bind to the mRNA .
In eukaryotes , translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis .
The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA .
The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is `` read '' by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape .
In many instances , the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and releases the nascent protein polypeptide inside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell .
Many types of transcribed RNA , such as transfer RNA , ribosomal RNA , and small nuclear RNA , do not undergo translation into proteins .
Translation proceeds in four phases : initiation , elongation , translocation and termination ( all describing the growth of the amino acid chain , or polypeptide that is the product of translation ) .
Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins .
In activation , the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA ( tRNA ) .
The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3 ' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond .
When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it , it is termed `` charged '' .
Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5 ' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors ( IF ) .
Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon ( UAA , UAG , or UGA ) .
No tRNA can recognize or bind to this codon .
Instead , the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex .
A number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation ; these include anisomycin , cycloheximide , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , streptomycin , erythromycin , and puromycin , among others .
Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes , and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host 's cells .
what is a mms message
A multimedia message on a mobile phone .
Multimedia Messaging Service ( MMS ) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from mobile phones .
It extends the core SMS ( Short Message Service ) capability that allowed exchange of text messages only up to 160 characters in length .
The most popular use is to send photographs from camera-equipped handsets , although it is also popular as a method of delivering news and entertainment content including videos , pictures , text pages and ringtones .
The standard is developed by the Open Mobile Alliance ( OMA ) , although during development it was part of the 3GPP and WAP groups .
where in the world are smallpox common
Smallpox was an infectious disease unique to humans , caused by either of two virus variants , Variola major and Variola minor .
The disease is also known by the Latin names Variola or Variola vera , derived from varius ( `` spotted '' ) or varus ( `` pimple '' ) .
The disease was originally known in English as the `` pox '' or `` red plague '' ; the term `` smallpox '' was first used in Britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola from the `` great pox '' ( syphilis ) .
The last naturally occurring case of smallpox ( Variola minor ) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977 .
Smallpox localized in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat .
In the skin it resulted in a characteristic maculopapular rash and , later , raised fluid-filled blisters .
V. major produces a more serious disease and has an overall mortality rate of 30–35 % .
V. minor causes a milder form of disease ( also known as alastrim , cottonpox , milkpox , whitepox , and Cuban itch ) which kills about 1 % of its victims .
Long-term complications of V. major infection include characteristic scars , commonly on the face , which occur in 65–85 % of survivors .
Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring , and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis are less common complications , seen in about 2–5 % of cases .
Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC .
The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt .
The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century ( including five reigning monarchs ) , and was responsible for a third of all blindness .
Of all those infected , 20–60 % —and over 80 % of infected children—died from the disease .
Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million deaths during the 20th century .
As recently as 1967 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year .
After vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in 1979 .
Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated , the other being rinderpest , which was declared eradicated in 2011 .
what year did the beatles came out with the song i wan na hold your hand
`` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' is a song by the English rock band the Beatles .
Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , and recorded in October 1963 , it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment .
With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom , `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release ( 29 November 1963 ) had it not been blocked by the group 's first million seller `` She Loves You `` , the Beatles ' previous UK single , which was having a resurgent spell in the top position following intense media coverage of the group .
Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor , `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total .
It was also the group 's first American number one , entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry .
By 1 February it held the number one spot — for seven weeks — before being replaced by `` She Loves You '' , a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain , and remained in the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks .
`` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' became the Beatles ' best-selling single worldwide .
what is a gasser car
A gasser was a type of hot rod originating on the dragstrips of the United States in the late 1950s and continued until the early 1970s .
Gassers were based on production models from the 1930s to mid-1960s , which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a truck beam axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration ( Beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension ) , though a raised stock front suspension is common as well .
Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels , stripped interiors and plexiglass windows ( sometimes color tinted ) .
Because they were primarily built for racing , these cars typically had the engine swapped to a larger or more powerful one , the existing stock engine modified ( often heavily ) or both .
It was very common to fit a Roots supercharger and mechanical fuel injection , such as one from Algon , Hilborn , or Crower .
With form being dictated by function , their appearance is often very top heavy and ungainly , largely due to front ends being raised higher than stock , to assist in the weight transfer during rapid acceleration ( racing ) .
Having their exhaust pipes exit through the front fender well is a common characteristic of gassers , as is having bodies painted in flamboyant metalflakes , pearls , and candy finishes complemented by lettering in wild fonts .
The name arose because they competed in a gasoline -fueled drag racing class , rather than one using methanol or nitromethane .
The gasser is the predecessor of the modern Funny Car .
when an ekg has T wave inversion in lead 2
Twelve-lead EKG of a 26-year-old male
Electrocardiography ( ECG or EKG from ) is a transthoracic ( across the thorax or chest ) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time , as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body .
The recording produced by this noninvasive procedure is termed an electrocardiogram ( also ECG or EKG ) .
An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats , as well as the size and position of the chambers , the presence of any damage to the heart , and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart , such as a pacemaker .
Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts , but may also be performed on animals , usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research .
what are some advantages that donald trump has had
Donald John Trump , Sr. ( born June 14 , 1946 ) is an American business magnate , television personality and author .
He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts .
Trump 's extravagant lifestyle , outspoken manner , and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No . 14 on the 2012 Forbes Celebrity 100 list .
Trump is the son of Fred Trump , a wealthy New York City real-estate developer .
He worked for his father 's firm , Elizabeth Trump & Son , while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , and in 1968 officially joined the company .
He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization .
In 2010 , Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for president of the United States in the 2012 election , though in May 2011 , he announced he would not be a candidate .
In December 2011 , Trump was suggested as a possible vice presidential selection by Michele Bachmann , if she were to win the Republican nomination .
who sang that song-a change is going to come
`` A Change Is Gon na Come '' is a 1964 single by R & B singer-songwriter Sam Cooke , written and first recorded in 1963 and released under the RCA Victor label shortly after his death in late 1964 .
Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles , the song came to exemplify the 1960s ' Civil Rights Movement .
The song has gained in popularity and critical acclaim in the decades since its release , and is # 12 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time .
who invented geothermal energy technology
Steam rising from the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland .
Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth .
Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter .
The Geothermal energy of the Earth 's crust originates from the original formation of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ) .
The geothermal gradient , which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface , drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface .
The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη ( ge ) , meaning earth , and θερμος ( thermos ) , meaning hot .
At the core of the Earth , thermal energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 °C ( 9,000 °F ) .
Heat conducts from the core to surrounding cooler rock .
The high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt , creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock .
The magma heats rock and water in the crust , sometimes up to 370 °C ( 700 °F ) .
From hot springs , geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times , but it is now better known for electricity generation .
Worldwide , about 10,715 megawatts ( MW ) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries .
An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating , space heating , spas , industrial processes , desalination and agricultural applications .
Geothermal power is cost effective , reliable , sustainable , and environmentally friendly , but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries .
Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources , especially for applications such as home heating , opening a potential for widespread exploitation .
Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth , but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels .
As a result , geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels .
The Earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity 's energy needs , but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited .
Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive .
Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology , energy prices , subsidies , and interest rates .
Pilot programs like EWEB 's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal .
But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience , the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the past two decades .
In 2001 , geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh .
what is a form of legal ownership
Ownership of property may be private , collective , or common and the property may be objects , land/real estate , or intellectual property .
Determining ownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the property .
These rights and duties , sometimes called a 'bundle of rights ' , can be separated and held by different parties .
The question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers , Plato and Aristotle , who held different opinions on the subject .
Plato ( 428/427 BC – 348/347 BC ) thought private property created divisive inequalities , while Aristotle ( 384 BC – 322 BC ) thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor .
Private property can circumvent what is now referred to as the “ tragedy of the commons ” problem , where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private property .
Given a short-sighted owner , however , a private property system can make these tragedies worse—for example , a private owner of a piece of oil-rich property , depending on his worldview , might be more interested in short-term financial gain than incremental use with an eye toward other 's concerns ( e.g. , those of future generations , the disenfranchised , etc . ) .
While Aristotle justified the existence of private ownership , he left open questions of ( 1 ) how to allocate property between what is private and common and ( 2 ) how to allocate the private property within society .
Over the millennia , and across cultures what can be property and how it is regarded culturally have varied widely .
Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money , trade , debt , bankruptcy , the criminality of theft , and private vs. public property .
Ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic system .
Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a person 's property and possessions .
The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex : one can gain , transfer and lose ownership of property in a number of ways .
To acquire property one can purchase it with money , trade it for other property , receive it as a gift , steal it , find it , make , it or homestead it .
One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money , exchanging it for other property , giving it as a gift , being robbed of it , it , or having it stripped from one 's ownership through legal means such as eviction , foreclosure , seizure , or taking .
Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property .
who wrote what 's my name rihanna
`` What 's My Name ? '' is a song recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna , for her fifth studio album Loud ( 2010 ) .
Featuring guest vocals from Canadian rapper Drake , the song was released as the second single from Loud on October 29 , 2010 through Def Jam Recordings .
The R & B song was produced by the Norwegian production duo StarGate , and was written by the duo along with Ester Dean , Traci Hale , and Drake .
Lyrically , it incorporates themes of sexual intercourse and romance .
Music critics gave the song positive reviews , citing it some of Rihanna 's best vocal work to date ; there was a praise regarding its romantic nature , as well as its sexual tones .
`` What 's My Name ? '' was a commercial success and topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , giving Rihanna her third number-one single in 2010 , as well as her eighth overall on the chart .
The song also topped the charts in Hungary and the United Kingdom and reached the top five in Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , Norway and Slovakia .
The song received a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration .
An accompanying music video , directed by Philip Andelman , portrays a romantic encounter between Rihanna and Drake in a grocery store along with romantic scenes between the pair and Rihanna walking through Manhattan 's Lower East Side .
`` What 's My Name ? '' was promoted with live performances across both sides of the Atlantic , including Saturday Night Live in America and the series seven finale of The X Factor in the United Kingdom .
The latter performance resulted in an investigation from the country 's media regulator , Ofcom , for the raunchy nature of Rihanna 's outfit .
what is a constant in math ?
A mathematical constant is a special number , usually a real number , that is `` significantly interesting in some way '' .
Constants arise in many different areas of mathematics , with constants such as e ( mathematical constant ) | and pi| occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry , number theory and calculus .
What it means for a constant to arise `` naturally '' , and what makes a constant `` interesting '' , is ultimately a matter of taste , and some mathematical constants are notable more for historical reasons than for their intrinsic mathematical interest .
The more popular constants have been studied throughout the ages and computed to many decimal places .
All mathematical constants are definable numbers and usually are also computable numbers ( Chaitin 's constant being a significant exception ) .
who won the SC election 2010
Elections to the United States Senate were held on November 2 , 2010 , for 37 of the United States Senate 's 100 seats .
( A special election on January 19 , 2010 in Massachusetts was held earlier in the year . )
Thirty-four of the seats were for six-year terms to the Senate 's `` class three '' , and three were special elections for shorter terms .
Of the 37 elections , 19 featured incumbent Democrats ( 7 of whom retired or were defeated in the primary ) and 18 featured incumbent Republicans ( eight of whom retired or were defeated in the primary ) .
After the previous elections ( in 2008 ) , the United States Senate was composed of 58 Democrats , 40 Republicans , and 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats .
Republicans won four seats held by retiring Democrats and Republicans defeated two incumbent Democrats .
This was the largest number of Republicans gains since the 1994 elections and also the first time since that election that Republicans successfully defended all of their own seats .
This was the fourth consecutive election of `` class 3 '' senators where Democrats have failed to gain seats and the third consecutive mid-term election held in a president 's first term where Republicans have picked-up seats .
Despite these Republican wins , however , the Democrats retained a majority of the Senate with 51 seats plus 2 independents who caucus with them , compared to the 47 Republicans .
where would you be standing on june 21 if the sun were directly overhead at noon .
A solstice is an astronomical event that occurs twice each year as the Sun reaches its highest or lowest excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere .
As a result , on the day of the solstice , the Sun appears to have reached its highest or lowest annual altitude in the sky above the horizon at local solar noon .
The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol ( sun ) and sistere ( to stand still ) , because at the solstices , the Sun stands still in declination ; that is , the seasonal movement of the Sun 's path ( as seen from Earth ) comes to a stop before reversing direction .
The solstices , together with the equinoxes , are connected with the seasons .
In many cultures the solstices mark either the beginning or the midpoint of winter and summer .
The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense , as the date ( day ) when this occurs .
The day of the solstice is either the longest day of the year ( in summer ) or the shortest day of the year ( in winter ) for any place outside of the tropics .
WHAT SINGER MARRIED HIS COUSIN
Jerry Lee Lewis ( born September 29 , 1935 ) is an American rock and roll and country music singer-songwriter and pianist .
He is known by the nickname `` The Killer '' and is often viewed as “rock & roll 's first great wild man” .
An early pioneer of rock and roll music , in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records .
`` Crazy Arms `` sold 300,000 copies in the South , but it was his 1957 hit `` Whole Lotta Shakin ' Going On `` that shot Lewis to fame worldwide .
Lewis followed this in that same year when he recorded songs such as `` Great Balls of Fire `` , `` Breathless `` and `` High School Confidential `` .
Lewis sold more records than Elvis Presley at this time .
However , Lewis ' rock 'n ' roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his young cousin .
He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded .
His live performance fees plummeted from $ 10,000 per night to $ 250 .
In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity .
During the early 60’s he did n't have much chart success with few exceptions such as `` What 'd I Say `` .
His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic .
His album Live at the Star Club , Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever .
After recording songs such as `` I 'm on Fire '' for several years with little success , in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as `` Another Place , Another Time '' .
This reignited his career and throughout the late '60s and '70s he regularly topped the country-western charts .
His # 1 country hits included `` To Make Love Sweeter For You `` , `` There Must Be More to Love Than This `` , `` Would You Take Another Chance on Me `` and `` Me And Bobby McGee `` .
Lewis 's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock 'n ' roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper 's `` Chantilly Lace `` and `` Rockin ' My Life Away `` .
In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour to audiences around the world and still releases new albums .
One such album , titled Last Man Standing , is his best selling to date at over a million copies sold worldwide .
This was followed by Mean Old Man which has received some of the best sales of Lewis’s career .
Lewis has had a dozen gold records in both rock and country , won several Grammy awards , including a Lifetime Achievement Award .
Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 , and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame .
In 1989 , his life was chronicled in the movie Great Balls of Fire , starring Dennis Quaid .
In 2003 , Rolling Stone Magazine listed his box set All Killer , No Filler : The Anthology number 242 on their list of `` 500 greatest albums of all time `` .
In 2004 , they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time .
Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records ' Million Dollar Quartet and the Class of '55 album , which also included Johnny Cash , Carl Perkins , Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley .
when did abraham lincoln write the emancipation proclamation ? ?
Henry Louis Stephens , untitled watercolor ( 1863 ) of a man reading a newspaper with headline `` Presidential Proclamation / Slavery '' .
The Emancipation Proclamation was an order issued to all segments of the Executive branch ( including the Army and Navy ) of the United States by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1 , 1863 , during the American Civil War .
It was based on the president 's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces ; it was not a law passed by Congress .
It proclaimed all those enslaved in Confederate territory to be forever free , and ordered the Army ( and all segments of the Executive branch ) to treat as free all those enslaved in ten states that were still in rebellion , thus applying to 3.1 million of the 4 million slaves in the U.S .
The Proclamation could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion , but as the army took control of Confederate regions , the slaves in those regions were emancipated rather than returned to their masters .
From 20,000 to 50,000 former slaves in regions where rebellion had already been subdued were immediately emancipated , and over 3 million more were emancipated as the Union army advanced .
The Proclamation did not apply to the five slave states that were not in rebellion , nor to most regions already controlled by the Union army ; emancipation there would come after separate state actions and/or the December 1865 ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment , which made slavery illegal everywhere in the U.S .
The Proclamation did not compensate the owners , did not itself outlaw slavery , and did not make the ex-slaves ( called freedmen ) citizens .
It made the eradication of slavery an explicit war goal , in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union .
On September 22 , 1862 , Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state of the Confederate States of America that did not return to Union control by January 1 , 1863 .
None returned , and the order , signed and issued January 1 , 1863 , took effect except in locations where the Union had already mostly regained control .
The Proclamation outraged white Southerners who envisioned a race war , angered some Northern Democrats , energized anti-slavery forces , and weakened forces in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy .
It also lifted the spirits of African Americans both in the Southern and Northern States , and led to many slaves escaping their masters and running behind Union lines in order to have their emancipation enforced .

A digital camera ( or digicam ) is a camera that takes video or still photographs by recording images on an electronic image sensor .
Most cameras sold today are digital , and digital cameras are incorporated into many devices ranging from PDAs and mobile phones ( called camera phones ) to vehicles .
Digital and film cameras share an optical system , typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device .
The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager , just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical .
However , unlike film cameras , digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded , and store and delete images from memory .
Many digital cameras can also record moving video with sound .
Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing .

who owns land rover
Land Rover is a British car manufacturer with its headquarters in Gaydon , Warwickshire , United Kingdom which specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles .
It is part of the Jaguar Land Rover group , a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India .
It is the second oldest four-wheel-drive car brand in the world ( after Jeep ) .
The Land Rover name was originally used by the Rover Company for one specific vehicle model , named simply the Land Rover , launched by Rover in 1948 .
Over the following years it developed into a marque encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models , including the Defender , Discovery , Freelander , Range Rover , Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque .
Land Rovers are currently assembled in the company 's Halewood and Solihull plants , with research and development taking place at JLR 's Gaydon and Whitley engineering centres .
Land Rover sold 194,000 vehicles worldwide in 2009 .
Although the brand originates from the original 1948 model , Land Rover as a company has only existed since 1978 .
Prior to this , it was a product line of the Rover Company which was subsequently absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation ( BL ) following Leyland Motor Corporation ’s takeover of Rover in 1967 .
The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models , and latterly the Range Rover in the 1970s in the midst of BL’s well documented business troubles prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company but still under the BL umbrella , remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988 , under the ownership of British Aerospace after the remains of British Leyland were broken up and privatised .
In 1994 Rover Group plc was acquired by BMW .
In 2000 , Rover Group was broken-up by BMW and Land Rover was sold to Ford Motor Company , becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group .
In 2006 Ford purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around £6 million .
This reunited the Rover and Land Rover brands for the first time since 2000 when the Rover group was broken up by BMW .
In June 2008 , Ford sold both Land Rover and Jaguar Cars to Tata Motors .
This sale also included the dormant Rover brand

what states have legalized prostitution
The regulation of prostitution in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government ; Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit , prohibit , or otherwise regulate commercial sex , except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws like the Mann Act .
In most states , prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime , a crime that disrupts the order of a community .
It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime .
Currently , Nevada is the only state to allow brothel prostitution , the terms of which are stipulated in the Nevada Revised Statutes .
Only 8 counties currently contain active brothels .
All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County ( which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area ) , Washoe County ( which contains Reno ) , Carson City , Douglas County , and Lincoln County .
The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution , but some of these counties currently have no active brothels .
Street prostitution , `` pandering , '' and living off of the proceeds of a prostitute remain illegal under Nevada law , as elsewhere in the country .
As with other countries , prostitution in the United States can be divided into three broad categories : street prostitution , brothel prostitution , and escort prostitution .

when president nixon resigns
Richard Milhous Nixon ( January 9 , 1913 – April 22 , 1994 ) was the 37th President of the United States , serving from 1969 to 1974 , when he became the only president to resign the office .
Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 .
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California .
He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937 , returning to California to practice law .
He and his wife , Pat Nixon , moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942 .
He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II .
Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 .
His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence .
He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election .
Nixon served for eight years as vice president .
He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962 .
In 1968 , he ran again for the presidency and was elected .
Although Nixon initially escalated America 's involvement in the Vietnam War , he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973 .
Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year .
Domestically , his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states .
Among other things , he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls , enforced desegregation of some Southern schools , and established the Environmental Protection Agency .
Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration .
He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972 .
Nixon 's second term saw an Arab oil embargo , the resignation of his vice president , Spiro Agnew , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration .
The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office .
After his resignation , he controversially received a pardon issued by his successor , Gerald Ford .
In retirement , Nixon 's work as an elder statesman , authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips , helped to rehabilitate his public image .
He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 .
when did sertraline come on the market
Sertraline hydrochloride ( trade names Zoloft , Lustral ) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) class .
It was introduced to the market by Pfizer in 1991 .
Sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive–compulsive , panic , and social anxiety disorders in both adults and children .
In 2011 , it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market , with 37,208,000 prescriptions .
The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants , but its side effects are much less pronounced .
Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects .
Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine ( Prozac ) for some subtypes of depression .
Treatment of panic disorder with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life .
For obsessive-compulsive disorder , sertraline is not as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments .
Although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder , sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions .
Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment .
Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs , with high rates of nausea , diarrhea , insomnia , and sexual side effects ; however , it does not cause weight gain , and its effects on both cognition and vigilance are relatively mild .
In pregnant women taking sertraline , the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood , and was also associated with a higher rate of various birth defects .
Similarly to other antidepressants , the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidality .

what are batteries made up of
A typical 12 V , 40 Ah Lead-acid car battery
An automotive battery is a type of rechargeable battery that supplies electric energy to an automobile .
Usually this refers to an SLI battery ( starting , lighting , ignition ) to power the starter motor , the lights , and the ignition system of a vehicle’s engine .
Automotive SLI batteries are usually lead-acid type , and are made of six galvanic cells in series to provide a 12 volt system .
Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volt at full charge .
Heavy vehicles such as highway trucks or tractors , often equipped with diesel engines , may have two batteries in series for a 24 volt system , or may have parallel strings of batteries .
Lead-acid batteries are made up of plates of lead and separate plates of lead dioxide , which are submerged into an electrolyte solution of about 38 % sulfuric acid and 62 % water .
This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons , allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity .
As the battery discharges , the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates , changing their surface to lead sulfate .
When the battery is recharged , the chemical reaction is reversed : the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide and lead .
With the plates restored to their original condition , the process may now be repeated .
Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for manufacture of new batteries , diverts toxic lead from landfills , and prevents risk of improper disposal .
what is a full job time ? ?
Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer .
Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time , temporary , or flexible workers , such as annual leave , sickleave , and health insurance .
Full-time jobs are often considered careers .
They generally pay more than part-time jobs , and usually carry more hours per week .
The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment .
This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer ( US Department of Labor ) .
The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's Employee Handbook .
Companies commonly require from 30–35 or 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits .
Full-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week .
The `` standard '' work week consists of five eight-hour days , commonly served between 9:00AM to 5:00PM totaling 40 hours .
While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days ; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36 hour work week .
Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week , unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime .
Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week .
The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half .
The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts .
Shifts can also be very irregular , as in retail , but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached .
There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time , which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker .

what are schedule 1 drugs according to iowa state law
The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 .
The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture , importation , possession , use and distribution of certain substances is regulated .
The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs .
The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ) , with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each .
Two federal agencies , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration , determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules , though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing , and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000 , which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate in Schedule I . Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse ( an undefined term ) , currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , and international treaties .

what lyndon b johnson like to as a boy
Lyndon Baines Johnson ( August 27 , 1908 – January 22 , 1973 ) , often referred to as LBJ , was the 36th President of the United States ( 1963–1969 ) , a position he assumed after his service as the 37th Vice President of the United States ( 1961–1963 ) .
He is one of only four people who served in all four elected federal offices of the United States : Representative , Senator , Vice President , and President .
Johnson , a Democrat from Texas , served as a United States Representative from 1937–1949 and as a Senator from 1949–1961 , including six years as United States Senate Majority Leader , two as Senate Minority Leader and two as Senate Majority Whip .
After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960 , Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election .
Johnson succeeded to the presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , completed Kennedy 's term and was elected President in his own right , winning by a large margin over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election .
Johnson was greatly supported by the Democratic Party and as President , he was responsible for designing the `` Great Society `` legislation that included laws that upheld civil rights , public broadcasting , Medicare , Medicaid , environmental protection , aid to education , and his `` War on Poverty . ''
Johnson was renowned for his domineering personality and the `` Johnson treatment , '' his coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation .
Meanwhile , Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War , from 16,000 American advisors/soldiers in 1963 to 550,000 combat troops in early 1968 , as American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down .
The involvement stimulated a large angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses in the U.S. and abroad .
Summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965 , and crime rates soared , as his opponents raised demands for `` law and order '' policies .
The Democratic Party split in multiple feuding factions , and after Johnson did poorly in the 1968 New Hampshire primary , he ended his bid for reelection .
Republican Richard Nixon was elected to succeed him .
Historians argue that Johnson 's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States after the New Deal era .
Johnson is ranked favorably by some historians because of his domestic policies .

who accompanied King louis the VII of France on the second crusade
The Second Crusade ( 1145–1149 ) was the second major crusade launched from Europe .
The Second Crusade was started in response to the fall of the County of Edessa the previous year to the forces of Zengi .
The county had been founded during the First Crusade ( 1096–1099 ) by Baldwin of Boulogne in 1098 .
While it was the first Crusader state to be founded , it was also the first to fall .
The Second Crusade was announced by Pope Eugene III , and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings , namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany , with help from a number of other European nobles .
The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe .
After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia , both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuq Turks .
The main Western Christian source , Odo of Deuil , and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus secretly hindered the crusaders ' progress , particularly in Anatolia where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them .
Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and , in 1148 , participated in an ill-advised attack on Damascus .
The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims .
It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century .
The only success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish , Frisian , Norman , English , Scottish , and German crusaders in 1147 .
Travelling from England , by ship , to the Holy Land , the army stopped and helped the smaller ( 7,000 ) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon , expelling its Moorish occupants .

what is a hosting company on a website
An example of rack mounted servers
A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web .
Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients , as well as providing Internet connectivity , typically in a data center .
Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other servers located in their data center , called colocation , also known as Housing in Latin America or France .
The scope of web hosting services varies greatly .
The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting , where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) or a Web interface .
The files are usually delivered to the Web `` as is '' or with minimal processing .
Many Internet service providers ( ISPs ) offer this service free to subscribers .
Individuals and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers .
Personal web site hosting is typically free , advertisement-sponsored , or inexpensive .
Business web site hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and type of the website .
Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages .
A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application development platforms ( e.g . PHP , Java , Ruby on Rails , ColdFusion , or ASP.NET ) .
These facilities allow customers to write or install scripts for applications like forums and content management .
Also , Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) is typically used for e-commerce .
The host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the Web server and installing scripts , as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail .
Some hosts specialize in certain software or services ( e.g . e-commerce ) , which are commonly used by larger companies that outsource network infrastructure .

where did the first airplane fly
The Wright brothers , Orville ( August 19 , 1871 – January 30 , 1948 ) and Wilbur ( April 16 , 1867 – May 30 , 1912 ) , were two American brothers , inventors , and aviation pioneers who were credited with inventing and building the world 's first successful airplane and making the first controlled , powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight , on December 17 , 1903 .
From 1905 to 1907 , the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft .
Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft , the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible .
The brothers ' fundamental breakthrough was their invention of three-axis control , which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium .
This method became standard and remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds .
From the beginning of their aeronautical work , the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving `` the flying problem '' .
This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines .
Using a small homebuilt wind tunnel , the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before , enabling them to design and build wings and propellers that were more efficient than any before .
Their first U.S. patent , 821,393 , did not claim invention of a flying machine , but rather , the invention of a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine 's surfaces .
They gained the mechanical skills essential for their success by working for years in their shop with printing presses , bicycles , motors , and other machinery .
Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle like a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice .
From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903 , they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots .
Their bicycle shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team , building their first aircraft engine in close collaboration with the brothers .
The Wright brothers ' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties .
Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators .

who owns exxon mobil
Exxon Mobil Corporation , or ExxonMobil , is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving , Texas , United States .
It is a direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil company , and was formed on November 30 , 1999 , by the merger of Exxon and Mobil .
It is affiliated with Imperial Oil which operates in Canada .
ExxonMobil is the world 's largest company by revenue and in 2013 , became the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization in the world .
The company is ranked # 5 globally in Forbes Global 2000 list in 2013 .
Exxon Mobil 's reserves were 72 billion oil-equivalent barrels at the end of 2007 and , at then ( 2007 ) rates of production , are expected to last over 14 years .
With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of , Exxon Mobil is the largest refiner in the world , a title that was also associated with Standard Oil since its incorporation in 1870 .
ExxonMobil is the largest of the world 's supermajors with daily production of 3.921 million BOE ( barrels of oil equivalent ) .
In 2008 , this was approximately 3 % of world production , which is less than several of the largest state-owned petroleum companies .
When ranked by oil and gas reserves it is 14th in the world with less than 1 % of the total .
A 2012 article in The Daily Telegraph says that ExxonMobil has `` grown into one of the planet’s most hated corporations , able to determine American foreign policy and the fate of entire nations '' .
In terms of its environmental record , ExxonMobil increasingly drills in terrains leased to them by dictatorships , such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea .
Lee Raymond , the corporation’s chief executive until 2005 , was `` notoriously sceptical about climate change and disliked government interference at any level '' .
The company was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning its 1989 Valdez oil spill in Alaska .
who built the globe
This article is about the Globe Theatre of Shakespeare .
For the modern reconstruction in London , see Shakespeare 's Globe .
For other uses , see Globe Theatre ( disambiguation ) .
The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare .
It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare 's playing company , the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , on land owned by Thomas Brend and inherited by his son , Nicholas Brend and grandson Sir Matthew Brend , and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613 .
A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed in 1642 .
A modern reconstruction of the Globe , named `` Shakespeare 's Globe `` , opened in 1997 approximately from the site of the original theatre .
who played in it 's a wonderful life
It 's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra , based on the short story `` The Greatest Gift `` , which Philip Van Doren Stern wrote in 1939 and privately published in 1945 .
The film is considered one of the most loved films in American cinema and has become traditional viewing during the Christmas season , alongside popular classics such as Charles Dickens ' A Christmas Carol .
The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey , a man who has given up his dreams in order to help others and whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel , Clarence Odbody ( Henry Travers ) .
Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be had he never been born .
Despite initially performing poorly at the box office due to high production costs and stiff competition at the time of its release , the film has come to be regarded as a classic and is a staple of Christmas television around the world .
Theatrically , the film 's break-even point was actually $ 6.3 million , approximately twice the production cost , a figure it never came close to achieving in its initial release .
An appraisal in 2006 reported : `` Although it was not the complete box office failure that today everyone believes ... it was initially a major disappointment and confirmed , at least to the studios , that Capra was no longer capable of turning out the populist features that made his films the must-see , money-making events they once were . ''
The film was nominated for five Oscars and has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made , placing number 11 on its initial 1998 greatest movie list , and would also place number one on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time .
what are warehouse spreadsheets used for
Data Warehouse Overview
In computing , a data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse ( DW , DWH , or EDW ) is a database used for reporting and data analysis .
It is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sources .
Data warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting such as annual and quarterly comparisons .
The data stored in the warehouse are uploaded from the operational systems ( such as marketing , sales etc. , shown in the figure to the right ) .
The data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before they are used in the DW for reporting .
The typical ETL -based data warehouse uses staging , data integration , and access layers to house its key functions .
The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems .
The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store ( ODS ) database .
The integrated data are then moved to yet another database , often called the data warehouse database , where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate facts .
The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema .
The access layer helps users retrieve data .
A data warehouse constructed from an integrated data source systems does not require ETL , staging databases , or operational data store databases .
The integrated data source systems may be considered to be a part of a distributed operational data store layer .
Data federation methods or data virtualization methods may be used to access the distributed integrated source data systems to consolidate and aggregate data directly into the data warehouse database tables .
Unlike the ETL-based data warehouse , the integrated source data systems and the data warehouse are all integrated since there is no transformation of dimensional or reference data .
This integrated data warehouse architecture supports the drill down from the aggregate data of the data warehouse to the transactional data of the integrated source data systems .
Data warehouses can be subdivided into data marts .
Data marts store subsets of data from a warehouse .
This definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage .
The main source of the data is cleaned , transformed , cataloged and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining , online analytical processing , market research and decision support ( Marakas & O'Brien 2009 ) .
However , the means to retrieve and analyze data , to extract , transform and load data , and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system .
Many references to data warehousing use this broader context .
Thus , an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools , tools to extract , transform and load data into the repository , and tools to manage and retrieve metadata .
what is a rock quarry
Portland stone quarry on the Isle of Portland , England
An abandoned construction aggregate quarry near Adelaide , South Australia
A quarry is a type of open-pit mine from which rock or minerals are extracted .
Quarries are generally used for extracting building materials , such as dimension stone , construction aggregate , riprap , sand , and gravel .
They are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement for large amounts of aggregate in those materials .
Open mines that produce minerals are typically referred to as open pit mines .
The word quarry can include underground quarrying for stone , such as Bath stone .
Who Started the Mormon Church
Mormons ( ) are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism , the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity , which began with the visions of Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s .
After Smith 's death in 1844 the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory .
Today Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) .
Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing .
The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah , and North America has more Mormons than any other continent , though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States .
Mormons have developed a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history .
During the 19th century Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location , and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage , a form of religious polygamy .
Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church , and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission .
Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages , tobacco , coffee , tea , and other addictive substances .
They tend to be very family-oriented , and have strong connections across generations and with extended family , reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death and throughout eternity .
Mormons also have a strict law of chastity , requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of marriage and strict fidelity within marriage .
Mormons self-identify as Christian , though some of their beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity .
Mormons believe in the Bible , as well as other books of scripture , such as the Book of Mormon .
They have a unique view of cosmology , and believe that all people are spirit-children of God .
Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ , and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism .
They believe that Christ 's church was restored through Joseph Smith , and is guided by living prophets and apostles .
Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers .
what is an asset account
In financial accounting , assets are economic resources .
Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value and that is held to have positive economic value is considered an asset .
Simply stated , assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash ( although cash itself is also considered an asset ) .
The balance sheet of a firm records the monetaryJ .
G. Siegel , N. Dauber & J. K. Shim , `` The Vest Pocket CPA '' , Wiley , 2005.There are different methods of assessing the monetary value of the assets recorded on the Balance Sheet .
In some cases , the Historical Cost is used ; such that the value of the asset when it was bought in the past is used as the monetary value .
In other instances , the present fair market value of the asset is used to determine the value shown on the balance sheet .
value of the assets owned by the firm .
It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business .
Two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets .
Tangible assets contain various subclasses , including current assets and fixed assets.J .
Downes , J.E . Goodman , `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '' , Baron 's Financial Guides , 2003 Current assets include inventory , while fixed assets include such items as buildings and equipment .J . Downes , J.E . Goodman , `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '' , Baron 's Financial Guides , 2003 ; and J. G. Siegel , N. Dauber & J. K. Shim , `` The Vest Pocket CPA '' , Wiley , 2005 .
Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place .
Examples of intangible assets are goodwill , copyrights , trademarks , patents and computer programs , and financial assets , including such items as accounts receivable , bonds and stocks .
what kind of potential is created after a neuron is excited
A neuron ( or ; also known as a neurone or nerve cell ) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals .
A chemical signal occurs via a synapse , a specialized connection with other cells .
Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks .
Neurons are the core components of the nervous system , which includes the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral ganglia .
A number of specialized types of neurons exist : sensory neurons respond to touch , sound , light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain .
Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord , cause muscle contractions , and affect glands .
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord .
A typical neuron possesses a cell body ( often called the soma ) , dendrites , and an axon .
Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body , often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times , giving rise to a complex `` dendritic tree '' .
An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance , as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species .
The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites , but never to more than one axon , although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates .
At the majority of synapses , signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another .
There are , however , many exceptions to these rules : neurons that lack dendrites , neurons that have no axon , synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite , etc .
All neurons are electrically excitable , maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps , which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium , potassium , chloride , and calcium .
Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels .
If the voltage changes by a large enough amount , an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated , which travels rapidly along the cell 's axon , and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives .
Neurons do not undergo cell division .
In most cases , neurons are generated by special types of stem cells .
Astrocytes , a type of glial cell , have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency .
In humans , neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas , the hippocampus and olfactory bulb , there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons .
who won the 2009 super bowl
Super Bowl XLIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Arizona Cardinals to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 2008 season .
The Steelers defeated the Cardinals by the score of 27–23 .
The game was played on February 1 , 2009 , at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa , Florida .
With this win , the Steelers became the first team to win six Super Bowls .
Pittsburgh , who finished the regular season with a 12–4 record , also won their second Super Bowl in four years after winning Super Bowl XL at the end of the 2005 season .
The Cardinals entered the game seeking their first NFL title since 1947 , the longest championship drought in the league .
The club became an unexpected winner during the regular season , compiling a 9–7 record , and the playoffs with the aid of head coach Ken Whisenhunt , who was the Steelers ' offensive coordinator in Super Bowl XL , and the re-emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner , who was the Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXIV with his former team , St. Louis Rams .
Pittsburgh jumped to a 17–7 halftime lead , aided by linebacker James Harrison 's Super Bowl record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown .
Trailing 20–7 at the start of the fourth quarter , Arizona scored 16 unanswered points , including wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald 's 64-yard touchdown reception , to take the lead with 2:37 remaining in the game .
But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes ' 6-yard game-winning touchdown catch with 35 seconds left .
Holmes , who caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown , including four receptions for 73 yards on that final game-winning drive , was named Super Bowl MVP .
He became the sixth wide receiver to win the award , and also was the third Pittsburgh receiver to win the award , following Lynn Swann and Hines Ward .
Despite the global financial crisis and limited amount of ancillary festivities that are normally held before the game , the NBC television network broadcast attracted an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers , making it the most watched Super Bowl in history to that point .
what wavelengths are the most harmful on the em spectrum
A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum , showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation .
The `` electromagnetic spectrum '' of an object has a different meaning , and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object .
The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength ( high-frequency ) end , thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom .
The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself , while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length , although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous .
Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions , as ways to study and characterize matter .
In addition , radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing ( see electromagnetic radiation for more applications ) .
Legend
what are the characteristics of bryophytes
Marchantia , a liverwort
Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes ( land plants ) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called ' non-vascular plants ' .
Some bryophytes do have specialized tissues for the transport of water ; however since these do not contain lignin , they are not considered to be true vascular tissue .
Currently bryophytes are thought not to be a natural or monophyletic group ; however the name is convenient and remains in use as a collective term for mosses , hornworts , and liverworts .
Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures ( gametangia and sporangia ) , but they produce neither flowers nor seeds , reproducing via spores .
The term bryophyte comes from Greek βρύον , bryon , `` tree-moss , oyster-green '' + φυτόν - phyton `` plant '' .
what is a good bank road ?
A bank is a financial institution and a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and channels those deposits into lending activities , either directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets .
A bank is the connection between customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses .
Due to their influence within a financial system and an economy , banks are generally highly regulated in most countries .
Most banks operate under a system known as fractional reserve banking where they hold only a small reserve of the funds deposited and lend out the rest for profit .
They are generally subject to minimum capital requirements which are based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords .
The oldest bank still in existence is Monte dei Paschi di Siena , headquartered in Siena , Italy , which has been operating continuously since 1472 .
It is followed by Berenberg Bank of Hamburg ( 1590 ) and Sveriges Riksbank of Sweden ( 1668 ) .
Banking in its modern sense evolved in rich cities of Renaissance Italy , such as Florence , Venice and Genoa .
In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties —among them notably Medici , Fugger , Welser , Berenberg , Baring and Rothschild —have played a central role over many centuries .
when did xbox release
The Xbox is a video game console manufactured by Microsoft .
It was released on November 15 , 2001 in North America , February 22 , 2002 in Japan , and March 14 , 2002 in Australia and Europe .
It was Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market .
As part of the sixth-generation of gaming , the Xbox competed with Sony 's PlayStation 2 , Sega 's Dreamcast ( which stopped American sales before the Xbox went on sale ) , and Nintendo 's GameCube .
The Xbox was the first console offered by an American company after the Atari Jaguar stopped sales in 1996 .
The integrated Xbox Live service launched in November 2002 allowed players to play games online with a broadband connection .
It first competed with Dreamcast 's online service but later primarily competed with PlayStation 2 's online service .
Although these two are free while Xbox Live required a subscription , as well as broadband-only connection which was not completely adopted yet , Xbox Live was a success due to better servers , features such as a buddy list , and milestone titles like Halo 2 released in November 2004 , which is the best-selling Xbox video game and was by far the most popular online game for years .
Xbox 's successor , the Xbox 360 , was launched in November 2005 .
The Xbox was discontinued in late 2005 in Japan where sales were poor .
It was discontinued in late 2006 in Europe and early 2007 in North America .
The last Xbox game in Europe was Tony Hawk 's Project 8 released in November 2006 , and the last game in North America was Madden NFL 09 released in August 2008 .
Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2 , 2009 , stating that any in-warranty repair now needed will not be undertaken .
Xbox access to Xbox Live was stopped on April 15 , 2010 .
what the multiple endings of john say about its possible authorship ;
The Gospel According to John ( Greek τὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην εὐαγγέλιον ) , commonly referred to as the Gospel of John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the Fourth Gospel , is an account of the public ministry of Jesus .
It begins with the witness and affirmation by John the Baptist and concludes with the death , burial , resurrection , and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus .
This account is fourth of the canonical gospels , after the synoptics Matthew , Mark and Luke .
states that the book derives from the testimony of the ' disciple whom Jesus loved . '
Along with Peter , the unnamed disciple is especially close to Jesus , and early-church tradition identified him as John the Apostle , one of Jesus ' Twelve Apostles .
The gospel is closely related in style and content to the three surviving Epistles of John such that commentators treat the four books together , yet , according to most modern scholars , John was not the author of any of these books .
Recent Christian Scripture scholarship more and more has placed John within a first-century Jewish context .
Raymond E. Brown did pioneering work to trace the development of the tradition from which the gospel arose .
The discourses seem to be concerned with the actual issues of the church-and-synagogue debate at the time when the Gospel was written .
It is notable that , in the gospel , the community still appears to define itself primarily against Judaism , rather than as part of a wider Christian church .
Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism , gradually Christians and Jews became bitterly opposed .
John presents a `` higher '' Christology than the synoptics , meaning that it describes Jesus as the incarnation of the divine Logos through whom all things were made , as the object of veneration , and more explicitly as God incarnate .
Only in John does Jesus talk at length about himself and his divine role , often shared with the disciples only .
Against the synoptics , John focuses largely on different miracles ( including resurrecting Lazarus ) , given as signs meant to engender faith .
Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John .
It presents a realized eschatology in which salvation is already present for the believer .
what are the ten things god cursed pharaoh with
The Plagues of Egypt ( ) , also called the Ten Plagues ( ) or the Biblical Plagues , were ten calamities that , according to the biblical Book of Exodus , Israel 's God , Yahweh , inflicted upon Egypt to persuade Pharaoh to release the ill-treated Israelites from slavery .
Pharaoh capitulated after the tenth plague , triggering the Exodus of the Jewish people .
The plagues were designed to contrast the power of Yahweh with the impotence of Egypt 's various gods .
Some commentators have associated several of the plagues with judgment on specific gods associated with the Nile , fertility and natural phenomena .
The plagues of Egypt are also mentioned in the Quran ( 7,133–136 ) .
According to the Book of Exodus , God proclaims that all the gods of Egypt will be judged through the tenth and final plague:
John Martin 's painting of the plague of hail and fire ( 1823 ) .
what is a roll play games
A role-playing game ( RPG and sometimes roleplaying game ) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting .
Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development .
Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines .
There are several forms of RPG .
The original form , sometimes called the tabletop RPG , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing games ( LARP ) players physically perform their characters ' actions .
In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used and acts as referee , while each of the other players plays the role of a single character .
Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multi-player text-based MUDs and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) .
Role-playing games also include single-player offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests , and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics .
These games often share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling .
Despite this variety of forms , some game forms such as trading card games and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included .
Role-playing activity may sometimes be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus .
The term is also sometimes used to describe roleplay simulation games and exercises used in teaching , training , and academic research .
when did the civil war start and where
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .
What are the busiest airports in the world
The definition of the world 's busiest airport has been specified by the Airports Council International in Geneva , Switzerland .
The ACI defines and measures the following three types of airport traffic:
Passenger traffic : total passengers emplaned and deplaned , passengers in transit counted once
Cargo traffic : loaded and unloaded freight and mail in metric tonnes
Traffic movements : landings and take-offs of aircraft
who staRTED WORLD WAR I ?
World War I ( WWI ) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918 .
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939 , and the First World War or World War I thereafter .
It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) .
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers .
Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
Within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .
While the Russians mobilised , the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France , providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany .
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans .
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai .
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916 .
In Russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers .
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front , the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches .
Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 .
The war ended in victory for the Allies .
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
By the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .
what part of the bp oil spill affected the water
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill ( also referred to as the BP oil spill , the BP oil disaster , the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and the Macondo blowout ) was an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP -operated Macondo Prospect , considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry , estimated to be between 8 % and 31 % larger in volume than the earlier Ixtoc I oil spill .
Following the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , which claimed 11 lives , a sea-floor oil gusher flowed unabated for 87 days , until it was capped on 15 July 2010 .
The total discharge is estimated at .
A massive response ensued to protect beaches , wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships , floating booms , controlled burns and of Corexit oil dispersant .
After several failed efforts to contain the flow , the well was declared sealed on 19 September 2010 .
Some reports indicate the well site continues to leak .
Due to the months-long spill , along with adverse effects from the response and cleanup activities , extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats , fishing and tourism industries , and human health problems have continued through 2013.Three years after the spill , tar balls could still be found on the Mississippi coast .
Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill .
Notably , the U.S. government 's September 2011 report pointed to defective cement on the well , faulting mostly BP , but also well operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton .
Earlier in 2011 , a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost-cutting decisions and an insufficient safety system , but also concluded that the spill resulted from `` systemic '' root causes and `` absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur '' .
In November 2012 , BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter , two misdemeanors , and a felony count of lying to Congress .
BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics , and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government .
BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $ 4.525 billion in fines and other payments but further legal proceedings not expected to conclude until 2014 are ongoing to determine payouts and fines under the Clean Water Act and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment .
As of February 2013 , criminal and civil settlements and payments to a trust fund had cost the company $ 42.2 billion .

where did halley 's comet come from
Halley 's Comet or Comet Halley ( or ) , officially designated 1P/Halley , is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years .
Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth , and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime .
Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular , but will appear only once in thousands of years .
Halley 's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BCE .
Clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by Chinese , Babylonian , and medieval European chroniclers , but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time .
The comet 's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley , after whom it is now named .
Halley 's Comet last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 .
During its 1986 apparition , Halley became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft , providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation .
These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction , particularly Fred Whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' model , which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water , carbon dioxide and ammonia – and dust .
The missions also provided data which substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance it is now understood that Halley 's surface is largely composed of dusty , non-volatile materials , and that only a small portion of it is icy .
what are the 40 largest cities in the us
The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States of America .
As defined by the United States Census Bureau , an `` incorporated place `` includes a variety of designations , including city , town , village , borough , and municipality .
A few exceptional Census Designated Places ( CDPs ) are also included in the Census Bureau 's listing of incorporated places .
Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county , or county equivalent .
Some consolidated city-counties , however , include multiple incorporated places .
This list presents only that portion ( or `` balance '' ) of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place .
Note that this list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits , which does not include other municipalities or unincorporated suburban areas within urban agglomerations .
A different ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations .

what is a forward in soccer
A New Zealand forward ( in white ) takes a shot on goal against Cameroon in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup .
Forwards , also known as strikers , are the players on a team in association football who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore principally responsible for scoring goals .
This very advanced position and its limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals than other players .
This position requires intelligence , speed , and power , both of execution and of thought , to perform the role well .
Modern team formations usually include one to three forwards ; two is the most common .
Coaches typically field one striker who plays in an advanced position ( the centre forward ) , and another attacking forward who plays somewhat deeper and assists in making goals as well as scoring ( the second striker ) .
It should be noted that inside forwards develop from attacking midfield positions and hence are naturally midfielders .
Barcelona FC star Lionel Messi is a typical Attacking Midfielder seen as a forward due to his shot accuracy .
WHO QUALIFIES AS A DOMESTIC PARTNER IN CA
A California domestic partnership is a legal relationship available to same-sex couples , and to certain opposite-sex couples in which at least one party is at least 18 years of age .
It affords the couple `` the same rights , protections , and benefits , and ... the same responsibilities , obligations , and duties under law ... '' as married spouses .
Enacted in 1999 , the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the United States created by a legislature without court intervention .
Initially , domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privileges—principally just hospital-visitation rights and the right to be claimed as a next of kin of the estate of a deceased partner .
The legislature has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to include all of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage .
As such , California domestic partnerships are functionally equivalent to civil unions offered in several other states .
Although the program enjoys broad support in California , it has been the source of some controversy .
Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court .
Conversely , advocates of same-sex marriage contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the `` separate but equal '' racial laws of the Jim Crow era .

Most South Africans can speak more than one language .
Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925 .
Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925 .
Dutch was replaced by Afrikaans when South Africa became a republic in 1961 , and Dutch was dropped in 1983 , so between 1983 and 1994 , South Africa had two official languages : English and Afrikaans .

Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho .
The main language of government is English even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose .
Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English .
In terms of linguistic classification , the official languages include two West-Germanic languages ( English and Afrikaans ) and nine Bantu languages .
Four of these are Nguni languages ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swati and Ndebele ) and three are Sotho–Tswana languages ( Northern Sotho , Southern Sotho and Tswana ) .
Tsonga is a Tswa–Ronga language .
South African Sign Language is a distinct though incompletely emerged national standard language which also subsumes a cluster of semi-standardised dialects .

Alaska ( ) is a state in the United States , situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent , with the international boundary with Canada to the east , the Arctic Ocean to the north , and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south , with Russia further west across the Bering Strait .
Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area , the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States .
Approximately half of Alaska 's 731,449 residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area .
Alaska 's economy is dominated by the oil , natural gas , and fishing industries ; it has these resources in abundance .
Alaska was purchased from Russia on March 30 , 1867 , for $ 7.2 million ( $ adjusted for inflation ) at approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) .
The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized ( or incorporated ) territory on May 11 , 1912 , and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3 , 1959 .
The name `` Alaska '' ( Аляска ) was already introduced in the Russian colonial period , when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq , meaning `` the mainland '' or , more literally , `` the object towards which the action of the sea is directed '' .
It is also known as Alyeska , the `` great land '' , an Aleut word derived from the same root .

what protects the vagina
The vagina ( from Latin vāgīna , literally `` sheath '' or `` scabbard `` ) is a tubular tract which is a sex organ and has two main functions ; sexual intercourse and childbirth .
In humans , this passage leads from the opening of the vulva to the uterus ( womb ) , but the vaginal tract ends at the cervix .
Unlike men , who have only one genital orifice , women have two , the urethra and the vagina .
The vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening , and both openings are protected by the labia .
The inner mould of the vagina has a foldy texture which can create friction for the penis during intercourse .
During arousal , the vagina gets moist to facilitate the entrance of the penis .
The Latinate plural `` vaginae '' is rarely used in English .
Colloquially , the word vagina is often used to refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general .
However , by its dictionary and anatomical definitions , vagina refers exclusively to the specific internal structure .

who said `` A picture is worth a thousand words '' ?
The adage `` A picture is worth a thousand words '' refers to the notion that a complex idea can be conveyed with just a single still image .
It also aptly characterizes one of the main goals of visualization , namely making it possible to absorb large amounts of data quickly .
The expression `` Use a picture .
It 's worth a thousand words . '' appears in a 1911 newspaper article quoting newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane discussing journalism and publicity .
1913 newspaper advertisement
A similar phrase , `` One Look Is Worth A Thousand Words '' , appears in a 1913 newspaper advertisement for the Piqua Auto Supply House of Piqua , Ohio .
An early use of the exact phrase appears in an 1918 newspaper advertisement for the San Antonio Light which says : One of the Nation 's Greatest Editors Says : One Picture is Worth a Thousand Words The San Antonio Light 's Pictorial Magazine of the War Exemplifies the truth of the above statement -- judging from the warm reception it has received at the hands of the Sunday Light readers .

A picture is worth a thousand words
Despite this modern origin of the popular phrase , the sentiment has been expressed by earlier writers .
For example the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev wrote ( in Fathers and Sons in 1862 ) , `` A picture shows me at a glance what it takes dozens of pages of a book to expound . ''
Computer programmer and author Fred Brooks makes an opposite statement regarding programming in The Mythical Man-Month : `` Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables , and I shall continue to be mystified .
Show me your tables , and I won’t usually need your flowcharts ; they’ll be obvious . ''
The phrase has also been spoofed by John McCarthy , the famous computer scientist , to make the opposite point : `` As the Chinese say , 1001 words is worth more than a picture . ''
what months are in each season
A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .
Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
In temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants to be dormant .
During May , June and July , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun .
The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November , December and January .
It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
However , due to seasonal lag , June , July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December , January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere .
In temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) .
However , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four .
Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season .
In some parts of the world , special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season , tornado season or a wildfire season .

Manning had never missed an NFL game in his career , but was forced to miss the entire 2011 season .
He was released by the Colts on March 7 , 2012 , and after an almost two-week period where he visited with and worked out for several NFL teams , he signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20 , 2012 .
Manning 's pre-snap routine has earned him the nickname , `` The Sheriff '' and is one of the most recognizable and parodied in the NFL .
The Indianapolis Colts ' almost exclusive use of the hurry-up offense led to Manning using an array of gestures and verbal commands to call the play at the line of scrimmage rather than in the huddle .

what is a penny made of
The United States one- cent coin , commonly known as a penny , is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States dollar .
The cent 's symbol is ¢ .
Its obverse has featured the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909 , the centennial of his birth .
From 1959 ( the sesquicentennial of Lincoln 's birth ) to 2008 , the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial .
Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln 's 200th birthday and a new , permanent reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010 .
The coin is 0.75 inches ( 19.05 mm ) in diameter and 0.061 inches ( 1.55 mm ) in thickness .
The U.S. Mint 's official name for a penny is `` '' and the U.S. Treasury 's official name is `` one cent piece '' .
The colloquial term penny derives from the British coin of the same name , the pre-decimal version of which had a similar value .
In American English , pennies is the plural form , other plural forms pence and pee ( standard use in British English ) are not used .
As of 2012 , it costs the U.S. Mint 2.00 cents to make a cent because of the cost of materials and production .
This figure includes the Mint’s fixed components for distribution and fabrication , estimated at $ 13 million in FY 2011 .
It also includes Mint overhead allocated to the penny , which was $ 17.7 million for 2011 .
Fixed costs and overhead would have to be absorbed by other circulating coins without the penny .
The loss in profitability due to producing the one cent coin in the United States for the year of 2012 was $ 58,000,000 .
This was a slight decrease from 2011 , the year before , which had a production loss of $ 60,200,000 .

what is a major trend in land plant evolution
A late Silurian sporangium .
Green : A spore tetrad .
Blue : A spore bearing a trilete mark – the -shaped scar .
The spores are about 30-35 μm across
The evolution of plants has resulted in increasing levels of complexity , from the earliest algal mats , through bryophytes , lycopods , ferns to the complex gymnosperms and angiosperms of today .
While many of the groups which appeared earlier continue to thrive , especially in the environments in which they evolved , for a time each new grade of organisation became more `` successful '' than its predecessors .
In the Ordovician period , around , the first land plants appeared .
These began to diversify in the late Silurian Period , around , and the results of their diversification are displayed in remarkable detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert .
This chert preserved early plants in cellular detail , petrified in volcanic springs .
By the middle of the Devonian Period , most of the features recognised in plants today are present , including roots , leaves and secondary wood ; and , by late Devonian times , seeds had evolved .
Late Devonian plants had thereby reached a degree of sophistication that allowed them to form forests of tall trees .
Evolutionary innovation continued into the Carboniferous period and is still ongoing today .
Most plant groups were relatively unscathed by the Permo-Triassic extinction event , although the structures of communities changed .
This may have set the scene for the appearance of the flowering plants in the Triassic ( ~ ) , and their later diversification in the Cretaceous and Paleogene .
The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses , which became important in the mid-Paleogene , from around .
The grasses , as well as many other groups , evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to survive the low and warm , dry conditions of the tropics over the last .
what teams won super bowl
The winning Super Bowl team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy .
The Super Bowl is an annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
The contest is held in an American city that is chosen three to four years beforehand , usually in warm-weather or domed sites .
Since 1971 , the winner of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs .
Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests .
The first two were known as the `` AFL-NFL World Championship Game . ''
Super Bowl III in 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker , the names `` Super Bowl I `` and `` Super Bowl II `` were retroactively applied to the first two games .
The NFC /NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 25 , while the AFC /AFL has won 22 .
Eighteen different franchises , including teams that relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl .
The Pittsburgh Steelers have won the most Super Bowls with six championships ( record 6–2 ) , while both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have five wins each ( Cowboys 5–3 ; 49ers 5–1 ) .
Dallas and Pittsburgh have the most Super Bowl appearances with eight , while the Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993 .
The New England Patriots , Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings have also lost a record four Super Bowls .
Buffalo and Minnesota are both 0–4 , Denver is 2–4 and New England is 3–4 .
The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the 1966-67 Green Bay Packers , the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins , the 1974-75 and 1978-79 Pittsburgh Steelers ( the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the 1988-89 San Francisco 49ers , the 1992-93 Dallas Cowboys , the 1997-98 Denver Broncos , and the 2003-04 New England Patriots .
The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII unseated and replaced the 49ers in that position .
Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns and Lions had won NFL Championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .

what is a normal alkaline phosphatase blood reading
Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP , ALKP ) ( ) is a hydrolase enzyme responsible for removing phosphate groups from many types of molecules , including nucleotides , proteins , and alkaloids .
The process of removing the phosphate group is called dephosphorylation .
As the name suggests , alkaline phosphatases are most effective in an alkaline environment .
It is sometimes used synonymously as basic phosphatase .
when do i plant triticale
Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , ( ) is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century .
The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden .
Commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first cross ) triticales .
As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye .
Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop .
Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents .
It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals .
When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) .
The resulting hybrid is sterile , and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself .
The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia .
In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world .
The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species .
In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid .
In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale .
Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time .
The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application .
The CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries .
Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals .
The protein content is higher than that of wheat , although the glutenin fraction is less .
The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat .
Assuming increased acceptance , the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale , as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale .
Sell et al . found triticale could be used as a feed grain , and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested .
As a feed grain , triticale is already well established and of high economic importance .
It has received attention as a potential energy crop , and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop 's biomass in bioethanol production .
who wrote puff the magic dragon
`` Puff , the Magic Dragon '' is a song written by Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow , and made popular by Yarrow 's group Peter , Paul and Mary in a 1963 recording .
The song achieved great popularity .
who has the most national championships
A college football national championship in the highest level of collegiate play in the United States , currently the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , is a designation awarded annually by various third-party organizations to their selection ( s ) of the best college football team ( s ) .
Division I FBS ( formerly Division I-A ) football is the only NCAA sport in which a yearly champion is not determined by an NCAA sanctioned championship event .
Because the championship team is not determined by a NCAA championship or tournament event , it is sometimes unofficially referred to as a `` mythical national championship `` .
Since the NCAA , the sport 's governing body , does not determine or declare a national champion in this field , determination of such has often engendered controversy .
A championship team is independently declared by various individuals and organizations , often referred to as `` selectors '' .
These choices are sometimes at odds with each other .
While the NCAA has never officially endorsed an annual championship team , it has documented the choices of several selectors in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records .
In addition , various third party analysts have independently published their own lists of what they have determined to be the most legitimate selections for each season .
These are also often at odds with each other as well as individual school 's claims on national championships , which , for any particular season , may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere .
Currently , two widely recognized national champions selectors are the Associated Press , which conducts a poll of football sportswriters , and the USA Today Coaches ' Poll , a poll of American Football Coaches Association active coaches that is contractually obligated to name the winner of the Bowl Championship Series championship game as its national champion .
where did the money for the new scoreboard in milwaukee come from
The Milwaukee Brewers are a professional baseball team based in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
The team is a member of the Central Division of Major League Baseball 's National League and plays its home games at Miller Park .
The team is so named because of the city 's association with the brewing industry .
when did expos become nationals
The Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team based in Washington , D.C .
The Nationals are a member of the East Division of the National League of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
The team 's home ballpark is Nationals Park , located on South Capitol Street in Southeast D.C. , near the Anacostia River .
The park opened in 2008 , replacing RFK Stadium , the team 's home from 2005 to 2007 .
The Nationals ' name derives from the former Washington baseball team that had the same name ( used interchangeably with Senators ) .
Their nickname is `` the Nats '' —a shortened version that was also used by the old D.C. teams .
An expansion franchise , the club was founded in as the Montreal Expos , the first major league team in Canada .
They were based in Montreal , Quebec , and played their home games at Jarry Park Stadium and later in Olympic Stadium .
In , the Expos won a division championship , won their first-ever playoff series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies , 3–2 , and advanced to the National League Championship Series , where they would go on to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers , 3–2 , in their only postseason appearance during the strike-shortened season .
The Expos had their highest winning percentage in the strike-shortened season of , when the team had the best record in baseball .
The team 's subsequent shedding of players caused fan interest to drop off .
After the 2001 season , MLB considered revoking the team 's franchise , along with either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays .
After being purchased by MLB in 2002 , the team was moved before the season to Washington and renamed the Nationals , the first relocation since the second Washington Senators moved to Arlington , Texas , and became the Texas Rangers in .
The Nationals are one of two MLB franchises , and the only one in the National League , that has never played in a World Series ( the Seattle Mariners are the other ) .
what is a contingent fee with an attorney
A contingent fee ( in the United States ) or conditional fee ( in England and Wales ) is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result .
In the law , it is defined as a `` fee charged for a lawyer 's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court ... .
Contingent fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the client 's net recovery . ''
In the English legal system , it is generally referred to as no win no fee .
A conditional fee agreement between a law firm and a client .
The usual form of this agreement is that the solicitor will take a law case on the understanding that if lost , no payment is made .
However , if the case is won , the lawyer will be entitled to the normal fee based on hourly billing , plus a success fee .
The success fee in England must be as a percentage no greater than 100 % of the normal fee .
This contrasts with the contingency fee in the US , which gives the successful attorney a percentage of the damages awarded in favor of his client .
This makes it easier for the poor to pursue their civil rights since otherwise , to sue someone for a tort , one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place .
However , because of the high risk , few attorneys will take cases on a contingency basis unless they feel the case has good merit .
According to a 2004 book by law professor Herbert Kritzer , contingent fees were allowed as of that year in the following countries : Australia , Brazil , Canada , the Dominican Republic , France , Greece , Ireland , Japan , New Zealand , the United Kingdom and the United States .
They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania .
Recently , they have been allowed in Belgium as well .
what is a college convocation

what type of volcano is grimsvotn
The Grímsvötn sub-glacial lakes ( ; vötn = `` waters '' , singular : ) and the volcano of the same name are in South-East Iceland .
They are in the highlands of Iceland at the northwestern side of the Vatnajökull ice-cap .
The lakes are at , at an elevation of .
Beneath the lakes is the magma chamber of the Grímsvötn volcano .
Grímsvötn is a basaltic volcano which has the highest eruption frequency of all the volcanoes in Iceland and has a southwest-northeast-trending fissure system .
The massive climate-impacting Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784 was a part of the same fissure system .
Grímsvötn was erupting at the same time as Laki during 1783 , but continued to erupt until 1785 .
Because most of the volcano lies underneath Vatnajökull , most of its eruptions have been subglacial and the interaction of magma and meltwater from the ice causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity .
On 21 May 2011 at 19:25 UTC , an eruption began , with high plumes accompanied by multiple earthquakes , resulting in cancellation of 900 flights in Iceland , and in the United Kingdom , Greenland , Germany , Ireland and Norway on 22–25 May .
Until 25 May the eruption scale had been larger than that of the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull .
The eruption stopped at 02:40 UTC on 25 May 2011 , although there was some explosive activity from the tephra vents affecting only the area around the crater .

what is a landed immigrant in canada
A Permanent Resident in Canada is a person who is not a Canadian citizen but who has been granted permission to live and work in Canada without any time limit on his or her stay .
A permanent resident must live in Canada for two years out of every five or risk losing that status .
A Permanent Resident holds many of the same rights and responsibilities as a Canadian citizen , among others the right to work for any enterprise as well as for the federal or provincial government ( under restriction of access rights to certain regulated professions ) .
The main differences are that residents can not :
vote in elections in Canada ;
run for elected office ;
hold Canadian passports ;
In addition , they may be allowed to join Canada 's armed forces if the national interest would not be prejudiced .
Permanent residents also risk deportation for serious crimes committed while resident in Canada .
Permanent residents may apply for Canadian citizenship after three years in Canada ; however this is not mandatory .

who reports the consumer price index
A graph of the US CPI from 1913 to 2006 ( in blue ) , and its percent annual change ( in red )
A consumer price index ( CPI ) measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households .
The CPI in the United States is defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as `` a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services . ''
The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically .
Sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services , being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index .
It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies .
The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation .
A CPI can be used to index ( i.e. , adjust for the effect of inflation ) the real value of wages , salaries , pensions , for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values .
In most countries , the CPI is , along with the population census and the USA National Income and Product Accounts , one of the most closely watched national economic statistics .
where does the expression `` knocking on wood '' come from
Knocking on wood , or to touch wood , refers to the apotropaic tradition in western folklore of literally touching/knocking on wood , or merely stating that you are doing or intend same , in order to avoid `` tempting fate `` after making a favourable observation , a boast , or declaration concerning one 's own death .
what are rocker arms ?
Rocker arm
Generally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive , marine , motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines , the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it .
One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft ( either directly or via a tappet ( lifter ) and pushrod ) while the other end acts on the valve stem .
When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm , the inside presses down on the valve stem , opening the valve .
When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation , the inside rises , allowing the valve spring to close the valve .
The drive cam is driven by the camshaft .
This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft .
Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller cam follower .
A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker arm .
This rotates about the rocker shaft , and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve .
In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head .
The effective leverage of the arm ( and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem ) is determined by the rocker arm ratio , the ratio of the distance from the rocker arm 's center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod .
Current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1 .
However , in the past smaller positive ratios ( the valve lift is greater than the cam lift ) and even negative ratios ( valve lift smaller than the cam lift ) have been used .
Many pre-WW2 engines use 1:1 ( neutral ) ratios .
For car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings , providing a reasonable balance of strength , weight and economical cost .
Because the rocker arms are , in part , reciprocating weight , excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engine 's ability to reach high operating speeds .
who sang the nights the lights went out
`` The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia '' is a Southern Gothic song written by songwriter Bobby Russell and performed in 1972 by his then-wife Vicki Lawrence .
Reba McEntire later covered it in 1991 .
Recorded in late October 1972 in United/Western Studios on Sunset in Hollywood and released less than two weeks later in November 1972 , the song centers around the older brother of the narrator , falsely convicted of and executed for a murder , which the narrator herself has committed .
where does the return address go on mail
In postal mail , a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message .
It provides the recipient ( and sometimes authorized intermediaries ) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed .
The return address need not include a sender 's name , but should include address or P.O . box details in the same way as the delivery address should .
In some countries , the return address is conventionally located in the upper left hand corner of the envelope , card , or label .
In the United Kingdom , the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope , near the top .
Businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address .
Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence .
Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots .
Rolls of Return Address Labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes .
The return address is not required on postal mail .
However , lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable ; such as from damage , postage due , or invalid destination .
Such mail may thus become dead letter mail .
Should the return address be of a different state or country , the mail may be routed through that location for ease of return .
what is a synthetic conduit
A nerve guidance conduit ( also referred to as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft , as opposed to an autograft ) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries .
When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve can not be accomplished without tension , the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting .
Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting , neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment , especially for large defects .
Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment .
The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials .
Whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube , synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit , it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap , block external inhibitory factors , and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth .
The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical , chemical , and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation .
Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles , while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively .
Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements : scaffold structure , scaffold material , cellular therapies , neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials .
The choice of which physical , chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment , which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration .
The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility , biodegradability , mechanical integrity , controllability during nerve growth , implantation and sterilization .

what is amoxicillin for ?
Amoxicillin BP
Amoxicillin ( INN ) , formerly amoxycillin ( BAN ) , and abbreviated amox , is a moderate-spectrum , bacteriolytic , β-lactam antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms .
It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed , following oral administration , than other β-lactam antibiotics .
Amoxicillin is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for children .
The drug became available in 1972 .
Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase -producing bacteria , which are resistant to a broad spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics , such as penicillin .
For this reason , it is often combined with clavulanic acid , a β-lactamase inhibitor .
This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to β-lactamase resistance .
where did lyndon b johnson tour to announce his war on poverty ?
Lyndon Baines Johnson ( August 27 , 1908 – January 22 , 1973 ) , often referred to as LBJ , was the 36th President of the United States ( 1963–1969 ) , a position he assumed after his service as the 37th Vice President of the United States ( 1961–1963 ) .
He is one of only four people who served in all four elected federal offices of the United States : Representative , Senator , Vice President , and President .
Johnson , a Democrat from Texas , served as a United States Representative from 1937–1949 and as a Senator from 1949–1961 , including six years as United States Senate Majority Leader , two as Senate Minority Leader and two as Senate Majority Whip .
After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960 , Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election .
Johnson succeeded to the presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , completed Kennedy 's term and was elected President in his own right , winning by a large margin over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election .
Johnson was greatly supported by the Democratic Party and as President , he was responsible for designing the `` Great Society `` legislation that included laws that upheld civil rights , public broadcasting , Medicare , Medicaid , environmental protection , aid to education , and his `` War on Poverty . ''
Johnson was renowned for his domineering personality and the `` Johnson treatment , '' his coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation .
Meanwhile , Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War , from 16,000 American advisors/soldiers in 1963 to 550,000 combat troops in early 1968 , as American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down .
The involvement stimulated a large angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses in the U.S. and abroad .
Summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965 , and crime rates soared , as his opponents raised demands for `` law and order '' policies .
The Democratic Party split in multiple feuding factions , and after Johnson did poorly in the 1968 New Hampshire primary , he ended his bid for reelection .
Republican Richard Nixon was elected to succeed him .
Historians argue that Johnson 's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States after the New Deal era .
Johnson is ranked favorably by some historians because of his domestic policies .

The show also features numerous supporting characters , each of whom plays a prominent role in a small group of episodes .
what state was the civil war in
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .
where did the early humans live ?
Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans .
While it began with the last common ancestor of all life , the topic usually covers only the evolutionary history of primates , in particular the genus Homo , and the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of hominids ( or `` great apes '' ) .
The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines , including physical anthropology , primatology , archaeology , linguistics , evolutionary psychology , embryology and genetics .
According to genetic studies , primates diverged from other mammals about in the Late Cretaceous period , and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene , around .
The family Hominidae diverged from the Hylobatidae ( Gibbon ) family 15-20 million years ago , and around , the Ponginae ( orangutans ) , diverged from the Hominidae family .
Bipedalism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line , and the earliest bipedal Hominin is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin , with Ardipithecus , a full bipedal , coming somewhat later .
The gorilla and chimpanzee diverged around the same time , about 4-6 million years ago , and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor with them .
The early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus Homo .
The earliest documented members of the genus Homo are Homo habilis which evolved around ; the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone tools .
The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee .
During the next million years a process of encephalization began , and with the arrival of Homo erectus in the fossil record , cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3 .
Homo erectus and Homo ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave Africa , and these species spread through Africa , Asia , and Europe between .
It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools .
According to the Recent African Ancestry theory , modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from Homo heidelbergensis , Homo rhodesiensis or Homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago , replacing local populations of Homo erectus , Homo denisova , Homo floresiensis and Homo neanderthalensis .
Archaic Homo sapiens , the forerunner of anatomically modern humans , evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago .
Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-African populations , and Neanderthals and other hominids , such as Denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6 % of their genome to present-day humans. < ref name= '' 10.1126/science.1209202 '' > Anatomically modern humans evolved from archaic Homo sapiens in the Middle Paleolithic , about 200,000 years ago .
The transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture , language , and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000 years ago according to many anthropologists although some suggest a gradual change in behavior over a longer time span .

what track and field event for me ?
Track and field is a sport comprising various competitive athletic contests based on running , jumping , and throwing .
The name of the sport derives from the competition venue : a stadium with an oval running track around a grass field .
The throwing and jumping events generally take place in the central enclosed area .
Track and field falls under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and race walking .
The two most prestigious international track and field competitions are held under the banner of athletics : the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics .
The International Association of Athletics Federations is the international governing body for track and field .
Track and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging each other to decide a single victor .
The racing events are won by the athlete with the fastest time , while the jumping and throwing events are won by the athlete who has achieved the greatest distance or height in the contest .
The running events are categorised as sprints , middle and long-distance events , relays , and hurdling .
Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer .
There are also `` combined events '' , such as heptathlon and decathlon , in which athletes compete in a number of the above events .
Records are kept of the best performances in specific events , at world and national levels , right down to a personal level .
However , if athletes are deemed to have violated the event 's rules or regulations , they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased .
In North America , the term track and field may be used to refer to athletics in general , rather than specifically track and field events .
what year was gulf war
The Gulf War ( 2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991 ) , codenamed Operation Desert Storm ( 17 January 1991 – 28 February 1991 ) was a war waged by a U.N.-authorized Coalition force from 34 nations led by the United States , against Iraq in response to Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait .
The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , or the First Iraq War , before the term `` Iraq War '' became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' ) .
Kuwait 's invasion by Iraqi troops that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council .
U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene .
An array of nations joined the Coalition .
The great majority of the Coalition 's military forces were from the U.S. , with Saudi Arabia , the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors , in that order .
Saudi Arabia paid around US $ 36 billion of the US $ 60 billion cost .
The war was marked by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight , with the primacy of the U.S. network CNN .
The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast images on board the U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm .
The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991 .
This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February .
This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces , who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory .
The Coalition ceased their advance , and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started .
Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq , Kuwait , and areas on Saudi Arabia 's border .
Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel .
What U.S. President 's head has been featured on the nickel ( five-cent coin ) since 1938 ?
The nickel , in American usage , is a five- cent coin issued by the United States Mint .
Composed of 75 % copper and 25 % nickel , the piece has been struck since 1866 .
The silver half dime , equal to five cents , had been issued since the 1790s .
The American Civil War caused economic hardship , driving gold and silver from circulation ; in response , in place of low-value coins , the government at first issued paper currency .
In 1865 , Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark , head of the Currency Bureau ( today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ) , placed his own portrait on the denomination .
After successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces , without precious metal , Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal ; the Mint began striking this version in 1866 .
The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck until 1883 , then replaced by the Liberty Head nickel .
The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of American coinage ; in 1938 , the Jefferson nickel followed .
In 2004 and 2005 , special designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were issued .
In 2006 , the Mint reverted to using Jefferson nickel designer Felix Schlag 's original reverse ( or `` tails '' side ) , although a new obverse , by Jamie Franki , was substituted .
As of 2013 , it costs more than eleven cents to produce a nickel ; the Mint is exploring the possibility of reducing cost by using less expensive metals .
what types of trees , flowers , or plants are commonly found in canada
A poster with flowers or clusters of flowers produced by twelve species of flowering plants from different families
A flower , sometimes known as a bloom or blossom , is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants ( plants of the division Magnoliophyta , also called angiosperms ) .
The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction , usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs .
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing ( fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population ) or allow selfing ( fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower ) .
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization ( parthenocarpy ) .
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop .
Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds .
Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals , so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen .
In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants , flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment , and also as objects of romance , ritual , religion , medicine and as a source of food .
When did F15s first fly
The McDonnell Douglas ( now Boeing ) F-15 Eagle is a twin-engine , all-weather tactical fighter designed by McDonnell Douglas to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat .
It is considered among the most successful modern fighters , with over 100 aerial combat victories with no losses in dogfights .
Following reviews of proposals , the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas ' design in 1967 to meet the service 's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter .
The Eagle first flew in July 1972 , and entered service in 1976 .
Since the 1970s , the Eagle has been exported to Israel , Japan , Saudi Arabia , and other nations .
The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft .
Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused .
The design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative , the F-15E Strike Eagle , was later developed , and entered service in 1989 .
The F-15 Eagle is expected to be in service with the U.S. Air Force past 2025 .

where did columbus really land in 1492 ?
Christopher Columbus ( Italian : Cristoforo Colombo ; Spanish : Cristóbal Colón ; Portuguese : Cristóvão Colombo ; before 31 October 145120 May 1506 ) was an Italian explorer , navigator , and colonizer , born in the Republic of Genoa , in what is today northwestern Italy .
Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain , he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general European awareness of the American continents .
Those voyages , and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola , initiated the Spanish colonization of the New World .
In the context of emerging western imperialism and economic competition between European kingdoms seeking wealth through the establishment of trade routes and colonies , Columbus 's speculative proposal , to reach the East Indies by sailing westward , eventually received the support of the Spanish crown , which saw in it a promise , however remote , of gaining the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative spice trade with Asia .
During his first voyage in 1492 , instead of reaching Japan as he had intended , Columbus landed in the Bahamas archipelago , at a locale he named San Salvador .
Over the course of three more voyages , Columbus visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles , as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America , claiming them for the Spanish Empire .
Though Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas ( having been preceded by the Norse expedition led by Leif Ericson in the 11th century ) , Columbus 's voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas , inaugurating a period of European exploration , conquest , and colonization that lasted for several centuries .
They had , therefore , an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern Western world .
Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the Christian religion .
Never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans , rather than the East Indies he had set out for , Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited indios ( Spanish for `` Indians `` ) .
Columbus 's strained relationship with the Spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and dismissal as governor of the settlements on the island of Hispaniola in 1500 , and later to protracted litigation over the benefits which Columbus and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown .
what is a brindle boxer
Bred in Germany , the Boxer is a breed of stocky , medium-sized , short-haired dogs .
The coat is smooth and tight-fitting ; colors are fawn or brindled , with or without white markings , which may cover the entire body .
Boxers are brachycephalic ( they have broad , short skulls ) , and have a square muzzle , mandibular prognathism ( an underbite ) , very strong jaws , and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey .
The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser , and is part of the Molosser group .
Boxers were first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich in 1895 , the first Boxer club being founded the next year .
Based on 2012 American Kennel Club statistics , Boxers held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the United States for the third consecutive year .
what are SATA Power Connector
Serial ATA ( SATA ) is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical drives .
Serial ATA replaces the older AT Attachment standard ( ATA ; later referred to as Parallel ATA or PATA ) , offering several advantages over the older interface : reduced cable size and cost ( seven conductors instead of 40 ) , native hot swapping , faster data transfer through higher signalling rates , and more efficient transfer through an ( optional ) I/O queuing protocol .
SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors .
In contrast , parallel ATA ( the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications ) used a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals , all operating at much lower frequency .
To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications , SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command-set as legacy ATA devices .
SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers , and has largely replaced PATA in new embedded applications .
SATA 's market share in the desktop PC market was 99 % in 2008 .
PATA remains widely used in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash storage , even though the new CFast standard is based on SATA .
Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from The Serial ATA International Organization ( aka .
SATA-IO , serialata.org ) .
The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates , reviews , ratifies , and publishes the interoperability specifications , the test cases , and plug-fests .
As with many other industry compatibility standards , the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies : primarily the INCITS T13 subcommittee ATA , the INCITS T10 subcommittee ( SCSI ) ; a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI ( SAS ) .
The complete specification from SATA-IO .
The remainder of this article will try to use the terminology and specifications of SATA-IO .
who invented the internet
The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s .
The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANet from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock 's laboratory at University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , after the second piece of network equipment was installed at Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) .
Packet switched networks such as ARPANET , Mark I at NPL in the UK , CYCLADES , Merit Network , Tymnet , and Telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols .
The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking , in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks .
In 1982 , the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was standardized , and consequently , the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected TCP/IP networks , called the Internet , was introduced .
Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) developed the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) and again in 1986 when NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations .
Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 .
The Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET was decommissioned , removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic .
Since the mid-1990s , the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce , including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail , instant messaging , Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) `` phone calls '' , two-way interactive video calls , and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums , blogs , social networking , and online shopping sites .
The research and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as NSF 's very high speed Backbone Network Service ( vBNS ) , Internet2 , and National LambdaRail .
Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s , 10-Gbit/s , or more .
The Internet 's takeover over the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993 , already 51 % by 2000 , and more than 97 % of the telecommunicated information by 2007 .
Today the Internet continues to grow , driven by ever greater amounts of online information , commerce , entertainment , and social networking .

After Harris ' death , Michael Gambon portrayed Dumbledore for all of the remaining films .
Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore , which is an Early Modern English word for `` bumblebee `` , because of Dumbledore 's love of music : she imagined him walking around `` humming to himself a lot '' .
what produces calcitonin
Calcitonin ( also known as thyrocalcitonin ) is a 32-amino acid linear polypeptide hormone that is produced in humans primarily by the parafollicular cells ( also known as C-cells ) of the thyroid , and in many other animals in the ultimobranchial body .
It acts to reduce blood calcium ( Ca2+ ) , opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) .
Calcitonin has been found in fish , reptiles , birds , and mammals .
Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals , as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis .
It belongs to calcitonin-like protein family .
what material is a mouse pad made out of ?

Some mousepads increase ergonomics by providing a padded wrist rest .
who hit the first home run at riverfront stadium ?
The stadium seen from above in 1980
December 29 , 2002 implosion
The Riverfront Stadium site in June , 2006 .
This photo was taken from the western concourse of Great American Ball Park .
A small portion of the Riverfront Stadium site is now occupied by the Reds ' Hall of Fame and Museum and Main Street , which was extended when the new park was built .
The Cincinnati Bengals ' Paul Brown Stadium is in the distance .
Riverfront Stadium ( 1970–1995 ) , later known as Cinergy Field ( 1996–2002 ) , was the home of the Cincinnati Reds National League baseball team and the Cincinnati Bengals National Football League team .
Located on the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati , the stadium was best known as the home of `` The Big Red Machine `` , as the Reds were often called in the 1970s .
Construction began on February 1 , 1968 , and was completed at a cost of less than $ 50 million .
On June 30 , 1970 , the Reds hosted the Atlanta Braves in their grand opening , with Hank Aaron hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront .
Two weeks later on July 14 , 1970 , Riverfront hosted the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game .
This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star Pete Rose and catcher Ray Fosse of the Cleveland Indians .
In September 1996 , Riverfront Stadium was renamed `` Cinergy Field '' in a sponsorship deal with Greater Cincinnati 's energy company , Cinergy Corporation .
In 2001 , to make room for Great American Ball Park , the seating capacity at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000 .
There was a huge wall in Center Field visible after the renovations , to serve as the batter 's eye .
The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29 , 2002 .

who did richard nixon refer to as the silent majority
The silent majority is an unspecified large majority of people in a country or group who do not express their opinions publicly .
The term was popularized ( though not first used ) by U.S. President Richard Nixon in a November 3 , 1969 , speech in which he said , `` And so tonight—to you , the great silent majority of my fellow Americans—I ask for your support . ''
In this usage it referred to those Americans who did not join in the large demonstrations against the Vietnam War at the time , who did not join in the counterculture , and who did not participate in public discourse .
Nixon along with many others saw this group of Middle Americans as being overshadowed in the media by the more vocal minority .
The phrase was used in the 19th century as a euphemism referring to all the people who have died , and others have used it before and after Nixon to refer to groups of voters in various nations of the world .
what year did the last monkeys go into space
Sam , a rhesus monkey , flew to an altitude of 88 km in 1959 .
( NASA )
Before humans went into space , several animals were launched into space , including numerous monkeys , so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of space travel .
The United States launched flights containing primate cargo primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985 .
France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967 .
The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996 .
Most monkeys were anesthetized before lift-off .
Overall thirty-two monkeys flew in the space program ; none flew more than once .
Numerous back-up monkeys also went through the programs but never flew .
Monkeys from several species were used , including rhesus monkeys , cynomolgus monkeys , squirrel monkeys , and pig-tailed macaques .
Some chimpanzees ( which are apes rather than monkeys ) were also used .
what raid levels use striping
RAID ( redundant array of independent disks , originally redundant array of inexpensive disks ) is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drive components into a logical unit .
Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways called `` RAID levels '' , depending on the level of redundancy and performance required .
The term `` RAID '' was first defined by David Patterson , Garth A. Gibson , and Randy Katz at the University of California , Berkeley in 1987 .
Marketers representing industry RAID manufacturers later attempted to reinvent the term to describe a redundant array of independent disks as a means of disassociating a low-cost expectation from RAID technology .
RAID is now used as an umbrella term for computer data storage schemes that can divide and replicate data among multiple physical drives : RAID is an example of storage virtualization and the array can be accessed by the operating system as one single drive .
The different schemes or architectures are named by the word RAID followed by a number ( e.g . RAID 0 , RAID 1 ) .
Each scheme provides a different balance between the key goals : reliability and availability , performance and capacity .
RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable ( sector ) read errors , as well as whole disk failure .
what are cytotoxic lymphocytes
A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell in the vertebrate immune system .
Under the microscope , lymphocytes can be divided into large lymphocytes and small lymphocytes .
Large granular lymphocytes include natural killer cells ( NK cells ) .
Small lymphocytes consist of T cells and B cells .
who narrates the big lebowski
The Big Lebowski is a 1998 dark comedy film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen .
Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski , an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler , nicknamed `` The Dude . ''
After a case of mistaken identity , The Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski .
When the millionaire Lebowski 's trophy wife is later kidnapped , he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release .
The plan goes awry when The Dude 's friend Walter Sobchak ( John Goodman ) schemes to keep the full ransom .
Steve Buscemi , Philip Seymour Hoffman , David Huddleston , Julianne Moore , Tara Reid , and John Turturro also star in the film , which is narrated by a cowboy known only as `` The Stranger '' , played by Sam Elliott .
The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler .
Joel Coen stated : `` We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically , and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery , as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that 's ultimately unimportant . ''
The original score was composed by Carter Burwell , a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers .
The Big Lebowski was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release .
Reviews have trended towards the positive over time , and the film has become a cult favorite , noted for its idiosyncratic characters , dream sequences , unconventional dialogue , and eclectic soundtrack .
who Plays snape in harry potter
Severus Snape is a fictional character in the Harry Potter book series written by J.K. Rowling .
In the first novel of the series , he is hostile toward Harry and is built up to be the primary antagonist until the final chapters .
As the series progresses , Snape 's character becomes more layered and complex .
Rowling does not fully reveal the details of his true loyalties until the end of the final book , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .
Over the course of the series , Snape 's portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a pivotal character of considerable complexity and moral ambiguity .
Snape primarily teaches Potions at Hogwarts , though in the sixth novel he teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts , a position which he was known to have desired throughout the series .
He ultimately becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts in the final novel .
Rowling has described him as `` a gift of a character '' .
what are grits made from
Grits refers to a ground-corn food of Native American origin , that is common in the Southern United States and mainly eaten at breakfast .
Modern grits are commonly made of alkali-treated corn known as hominy .
Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta or the thinner farina .
`` Instant grits '' have been processed to speed cooking .
The word `` grits '' derives from the Old English word `` grytt , '' meaning coarse meal .
This word originally referred to wheat and other porridges now known as groats in parts of the U.K..
Maize , unknown in Europe in the Middle Ages , is a food derived from corn ( a New World plant ) and `` corn '' had been used to describe wheat products in many European regions .
`` Grits '' may be either singular or plural ; historically , in the American South the word was invariably singular notwithstanding its plural form ( cf . such food names as `` spaghetti '' or `` linguine '' , likewise plural in form , but singular in use ) .
Sometimes , grits are called sofkee or sofkey ( from a native American Muskogee word ) .
when does embryo secrete hgh
In molecular biology , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception .
Later during pregnancy it is made by the developing placenta , and later by the placental component syncytiotrophoblast .
Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone ; therefore , elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis .
However , it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis .
The pituitary analogue of hCG , known as luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages .
, the FDA has prohibited the sale of `` homeopathic '' and over the counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal .
when did coca cola first come out
The Las Vegas Strip World of Coca-Cola museum in 2003
Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores , restaurants , and vending machines in every country except Cuba and North Korea .
It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta , Georgia , and is often referred to simply as Coke ( a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27 , 1944 ) .
Originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton , Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler , whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century .
The company produces concentrate , which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world .
The bottlers , who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company , produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners .
The bottlers then sell , distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores and vending machines .
Such bottlers include Coca-Cola Enterprises , which is the largest single Coca-Cola bottler in North America and western Europe .
The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains to major restaurants and food service distributors .
The Coca-Cola Company has , on occasion , introduced other cola drinks under the Coke brand name .
The most common of these is Diet Coke , with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola , Diet Coke Caffeine-Free , Coca-Cola Cherry , Coca-Cola Zero , Coca-Cola Vanilla , and special versions with lemon , lime or coffee .
Based on Interbrand 's best global brand 2011 , Coca-Cola was the world 's most valuable brand .
what role do ombudsman play in the swedish government ?
An ombudsman is an official , usually appointed by the government or by parliament but with a significant degree of independence , who is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints of maladministration or violation of rights .
In some countries an Inspector General , Citizen Advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman , and may also be appointed by the legislature .
Below the national level an ombudsman may be appointed by a state , local or municipal government , and unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by , or even work for , a corporation such as a utility supplier or a newspaper , for an NGO , or for a professional regulatory body .
Whether appointed by the legislature , the executive , or an organization ( or , less frequently , elected by the constituency that he or she serves ) , the typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them , usually through recommendations ( binding or not ) or mediation .
Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people 's rights .
At the national level , most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector , and sometimes also elements of the private sector ( for example , contracted service providers ) .
In some cases , there is a more restricted mandate , for example with particular sectors of society .
More recent developments have included the creation of specialised Children 's Ombudsman and Information Commissioner agencies .
In some jurisdictions an ombudsman charged with the handling of concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the `` Parliamentary Commissioner '' ( e.g . the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration , and the Western Australian state Ombudsman ) .
In many countries where the ombudsman 's remit extends beyond dealing with alleged maladministration to promoting and protecting human rights , the ombudsman is recognised as the national human rights institution .
The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union .
Making a complaint to an ombudsman is usually free of charge .

what state is new england in
Autumn in New England , watercolor , Maurice Prendergast .
Ca . 1910–1913
Fall foliage in the town of Stowe , Vermont
New England is a region in the northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut .
New England is bordered by New York state to the southwest , Quebec to the northwest , and New Brunswick and the Atlantic Ocean to the east .
In one of the earliest English settlements in North America , Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620 , to form Plymouth Colony .
Ten years later , the Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston , thus forming Massachusetts Bay Colony .
Over the next 130 years , New England fought in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America .
In the late 18th century , the New England Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament 's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists .
The Boston Tea Party was a protest to which Great Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government , which were termed the `` Intolerable Acts `` by the colonists .
The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775 , the expulsion of the British authorities from New England in spring 1776 , and the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 .
Some of the first movements of American literature , philosophy , and education originated in New England .
The region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery , and was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution .
Today , New England is a major world center of education , high technology , insurance , and medicine .
Boston is its cultural , financial , educational , medical and transportation center .
Each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as New England towns , which are often governed by town meeting .
The only unincorporated territory in New England exists in the sparse , northern regions of Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine .
Since 1970 , voters have more often supported liberal candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the United States .
New England is the only one of the United States Census Bureau 's nine regional divisions whose name does not derive from its geography , and it is the only multi-state region with clear , consistent boundaries .
It maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country , although the terms of this identity are often contested , combining Puritanism with liberalism , agrarian life with industry , and isolation with immigration .
who starred in the drama emergency
Emergency !
is an American television series that combines the medical drama and action-adventure genres .
It was produced by Mark VII Limited and distributed by Universal Studios .
It debuted as a midseason replacement on January 15 , 1972 , on NBC , replacing the two short-lived series The Partners and The Good Life , and ran until September 3 , 1977 , with six additional two-hour television films during the following two years .
Emergency !
was created and produced by Jack Webb and Robert A. Cinader , both of whom were also responsible for the police dramas Adam-12 and Dragnet .
What states are in the Eastern Standard time zone ?
The Eastern Time Zone ( ET ) encompasses 17 U.S. states in the eastern part of the contiguous United States , parts of Canada and three countries in South America .
Places that use Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) when observing standard time ( autumn/winter ) are 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time ( ) .
Eastern Daylight Time ( EDT ) , when observing daylight saving time ( spring/summer ) is 4 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time ( ) .
In the northern parts of the time zone , during the second Sunday in March , at 2:00 a.m. EST , clocks are advanced to 3:00 a.m. EDT leaving a one hour `` gap . ''
During the first Sunday in November , at 2:00 a.m. EDT , clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.m. EST , thus `` duplicating '' one hour .
Southern parts of the zone ( Panama and the Caribbean ) do not observe daylight saving .
what is an atomic number periodic table
Standard form of the periodic table .
The colors represent different categories of elements explained below .
The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements , organized on the basis of their atomic numbers , electron configurations , and recurring chemical properties .
Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ) .
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main body of elements , positioned above a smaller double row of elements .
The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left , the p-block to the right , the d-block in the middle , and the f-block below that .
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s- , d- , and p-blocks are called groups , with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases .
Since , by definition , a periodic table incorporates recurring trends , any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new , yet to be discovered or synthesized , elements .
As a result , a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior , and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences .
Although precursors exist , Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication , in 1869 , of the first widely recognized periodic table .
He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements .
Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table .
Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered .
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior .
All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized .
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally , although some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories .
The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories .
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued , with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate .
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories .

who played batman in dark knight
The Dark Knight is a 2008 British-American superhero film directed , produced , and co-written by Christopher Nolan .
Based on the DC Comics character Batman , the film is the second part of Nolan 's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005 's Batman Begins .
Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman , with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth , Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox .
The film introduces the character of Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) , Gotham 's newly elected District Attorney and the consort of Bruce Wayne 's childhood friend Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) , who joins Batman and the police in combating the new rising threat of a criminal mastermind calling himself `` The Joker `` ( Heath Ledger ) .
Nolan 's inspiration for the film was the Joker 's comic book debut in 1940 , the 1988 graphic novel , and the 1996 series , which retold Two-Face 's origin .
The nickname `` the Dark Knight '' was first applied to Batman in Batman No . 1 ( 1940 ) , in a story written by Bill Finger .
The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago , as well as in several other locations in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Hong Kong .
Nolan used an IMAX camera to film some sequences , including the Joker 's first appearance in the film .
On January 22 , 2008 , some months after he had completed filming on The Dark Knight and six months before the film 's release , Heath Ledger died from a toxic combination of prescription drugs , leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public .
Warner Bros. had initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight , developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker , but after Ledger 's death , the studio refocused its promotional campaign .
The Dark Knight was released on July 16 , 2008 in Australia , on July 18 , 2008 in North America , and on July 24 , 2008 in the United Kingdom .
Considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made , the film received highly positive reviews and set numerous records during its theatrical run .
With over $ 1 billion in revenue worldwide , it is the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time , unadjusted for inflation .
The film received eight Academy Award nominations ; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor .
The Dark Knight Rises , the final part of the trilogy , was released on July 20 , 2012 .

what people sung at sydney opera house
The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in New South Wales , Australia .
It was conceived and largely built by Danish architect Jørn Utzon , opening in 1973 after a long gestation that began with his competition-winning design in 1957 .
Joseph Cahill 's New South Wales Government gave the go-ahead for work to begin in 1958 .
The government 's bold decision to select Utzon 's design is often overshadowed by the scandal that followed .
It is on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour , close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge .
It sits at the northeastern tip of the Sydney central business district ( the CBD ) , surrounded on three sides by the harbour ( Sydney Cove and Farm Cove ) and inland by the Royal Botanic Gardens .
Contrary to its name , it houses multiple performance venues .
It is among the busiest performing arts centres in the world , hosting over 1,500 performances each year attended by some 1.2 million people .
It provides a venue for many performing-arts companies , including the four key resident companies Opera Australia , The Australian Ballet , the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , and presents a wide range of productions on its own account .
It is also one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia , with more than seven million people visiting each year , 300,000 of whom take a guided tour .
It is administered by the Sydney Opera House Trust , under the New South Wales Ministry of the Arts .
On 28 June 2007 , it was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
It is one of the 20th century 's most distinctive buildings and one of the most famous performing arts centres in the world .
what is a good bmi
A graph of body mass index as a function of body mass and body height is shown above .
The dashed lines represent subdivisions within a major class .
For instance the `` Underweight '' classification is further divided into `` severe '' , `` moderate '' , and `` mild '' subclasses .
The body mass index ( BMI ) , or Quetelet index , is a measure for human body shape based on an individual 's weight and height .
It was devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing `` social physics '' .
Body mass index is defined as the individual 's body mass divided by the square of their height .
The formulae universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2 .
BMI can also be determined using a BMI chart , which displays BMI as a function of weight ( horizontal axis ) and height ( vertical axis ) using contour lines for different values of BMI or colors for different BMI categories .
† The factor for UK/US units is more precisely 703.06957964 , but that level of precision is not meaningful for this calculation .
To work from stone and pounds first multiply the stone by 14 then add the pounds to give the whole mass in pounds ; to work from feet and inches first multiply the feet by 12 then add the inches to give the whole height in inches .
what kind of person was thomas paine
Thomas Paine ( January 29 , 1737 ( NS February 9 , 1737 ) – June 8 , 1809 ) was an English-American political activist , author , political theorist and revolutionary .
As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution , he inspired the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain .
His ideas reflected Enlightenment era rhetoric of transnational human rights .
He has been called `` a corsetmaker by trade , a journalist by profession , and a propagandist by inclination . ''
Born in Thetford , England , in the county of Norfolk , Paine emigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of Benjamin Franklin and he arrived in time to participate in the American Revolution .
His principal contributions were the powerful , widely read pamphlet Common Sense ( 1776 ) , the all-time best-selling American book that advocated colonial America 's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain , and The American Crisis ( 1776–83 ) , a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series .
Common Sense was so influential that John Adams said , `` Without the pen of the author of Common Sense , the sword of Washington would have been raised in vain.”
Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s , becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution .
He wrote the Rights of Man ( 1791 ) , in part a defence of the French Revolution against its critics .
His attacks on British writer Edmund Burke led to a trial and conviction in absentia in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel .
In 1792 , despite not being able to speak French , he was elected to the French National Convention .
The Girondists regarded him as an ally .
Consequently , the Montagnards , especially Robespierre , regarded him as an enemy .
In December 1793 , he was arrested and imprisoned in Paris , then released in 1794 .
He became notorious because of The Age of Reason ( 1793–94 ) , his book that advocates deism , promotes reason and freethinking , and argues against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular .
He also wrote the pamphlet Agrarian Justice ( 1795 ) , discussing the origins of property , and introduced the concept of a guaranteed minimum income .
In 1802 , he returned to America where he died on June 8 , 1809 .
Only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity .
what phase clinical trial new drug application
Clinical trials are sets of tests in medical research and drug development that generate safety and efficacy data ( or more specifically , information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments ) for health interventions ( e.g. , drugs , diagnostics , devices , therapy protocols ) .
They are conducted only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non clinical safety , and health authority/ethics committee approval is granted in the country where approval of the drug or device is sought .
Previously , many emerging countries did not require local trials for product approvals .
Now , though emerging countries still accept data from U.S./Europe , they also require some local trials .
Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development , investigators initially enroll volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with others already approved for the affliction of interest .
As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered , the number of patients is typically increased .
Clinical trials can vary in size , and can involve a single research entity in one country or many such entities in multiple countries .
A full series of trials may incur sizable costs , and the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor , which may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical , biotechnology or medical device company .
When the diversity of required support roles exceeds the resources of the sponsor , a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner , such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector .
where did the nickname packers come from green bay
The Green Bay Packers are an American football team based in Green Bay , Wisconsin .
They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) in the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Green Bay is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL , having been organized and playing in 1919 .
The Packers are the only non-profit , community-owned major league professional sports team in the United States .
The Packers are the last vestige of `` small town teams '' that were once common in the NFL during the 1920s and 1930s .
Founded in 1919 by Earl `` Curly '' Lambeau ( hence the name Lambeau Field on which the team plays ) and George Whitney Calhoun , the Green Bay Packers can trace their lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896 .
In 1919 and 1920 the Packers competed as a semi-professional football team against clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest .
They joined the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) in 1921 , the forerunner to what is known today as the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Although Green Bay is the last NFL `` small town '' team , its local fan base and media extends into nearby Milwaukee ; the team also played selected home games there between 1933 and 1994 .
The Green Bay Packers have won 13 league championships ( more than any other team in the NFL ) , including nine NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowl victories —in 1967 ( Super Bowl I ) , 1968 ( Super Bowl II ) , 1997 ( Super Bowl XXXI ) and 2011 ( Super Bowl XLV ) .
The Packers have long-standing , bitter rivalries with their NFC North ( formerly the NFC Central ) opponents , the Chicago Bears , Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions .
The Bears-Packers rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in NFL history , dating back to 1921 .
what part of the corn is used in ethanol production
Ethanol fuel is ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) , the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages .
It is most often used as a motor fuel , mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline .
World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17 billion to more than 52 billion liters .
From 2007 to 2008 , the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7 % to 5.4 % .
In 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached 22.36 billion U.S. liquid gallons ( bg ) ( 84.6 billion liters ) , with the United States as the top producer with 13.9 bg ( 52.6 billion liters ) , accounting for 62.2 % of global production , followed by Brazil with 5.6 bg ( 21.1 billion liters ) .
Ethanol fuel has a `` gasoline gallon equivalency `` ( GGE ) value of , which means 1.5 gallons of ethanol produce the energy of one gallon of gasoline .
Ethanol fuel is widely used in Brazil and in the United States , and together both countries were responsible for 87.1 % of the world 's ethanol fuel production in 2011 .
Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10 % ethanol , and ethanol represented 10 % of the U.S. gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011 .
Since 1976 the Brazilian government has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline , and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25 % ethanol and 75 % gasoline ( E25 ) .
By December 2011 Brazil had a fleet of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles that regularly use neat ethanol fuel ( known as E100 ) .
Bioethanol is a form of renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks .
It can be made from very common crops such as sugar cane , potato , manioc and corn .
There has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol will be in replacing gasoline .
Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops , as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production , especially from corn .
Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns .
Cellulosic ethanol offers promise because cellulose fibers , a major and universal component in plant cells walls , can be used to produce ethanol .
According to the International Energy Agency , cellulosic ethanol could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought .

A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination ( image taken in 2009 )
On 28 June 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne , and his wife , Sophie , Duchess of Hohenberg , were shot dead in Sarajevo , by Gavrilo Princip , one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić .
The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary 's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia .
The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia .
Serbian military officers stood behind the attack .
At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić , and Masterspy Rade Malobabić .
Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them .
The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary .
The assassins , the key members of the clandestine tunnel , and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested , tried , convicted and punished .
Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914 .
The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges ; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators .
Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records .
Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later .

what are the three ossicles
The ossicles ( also called auditory ossicles ) are the three smallest bones in the human body , the malleus , the incus and the stapes .
They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth ( cochlea ) .
The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe hearing loss .
The term `` ossicles '' literally means `` tiny bones '' and commonly refers to the auditory ossicles , though the term may refer to any small bone throughout the body .

The New Covenant ( Hebrew • • — Greek • • diatheke kaine ) is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah , in the Hebrew Scriptures .
It is often thought of as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to come and is related to the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God .
Generally , Christians believe that the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist , which in the Gospel of John includes the New Commandment .
There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant , as an example an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ ; that is , it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts , but in the future external world as well .
The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament with the saying : `` this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood '' .
Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant , and that the Blood of Christ shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant .
As with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible , the New Covenant is considered `` a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God . ''
It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ as spoken during his Sermon on the Mount .
who have presidents pardoned
The following List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States documents the most prominent cases of each presidency .
As granted by the Constitution ( Article II , Section 2 , Clause 1 ) , Presidents have the power to grant clemency in one or more of the following ways : the ability to grant a full pardon , to commute a sentence , or to rescind a fine .
U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law .
As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation:
A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction .
A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction , without vacating the conviction itself .
Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone .
The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934 .
In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed .
This list includes pardons and commutations .
what time is it in tampa florida
Tampa ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Florida .
It serves as the county seat for Hillsborough County and is located on the west coast of Florida , on Tampa Bay near the Gulf of Mexico .
The population of Tampa in 2011 was 346,037 .
The current location of Tampa was once inhabited by indigenous peoples of the Safety Harbor culture , most notably the Tocobaga and the Pohoy , who lived along the shores of Tampa Bay .
It was briefly explored by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century , but there were no permanent American or European settlements within today 's city limits until after the United States had acquired Florida from Spain in 1819 .
In 1824 , the United States Army established a frontier outpost called Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River , near the site of today 's Tampa Convention Center .
The first civilian residents were pioneers who settled near the fort for protection from the nearby Seminole population .
The town grew slowly until the 1880s , when railroad links , the discovery of phosphate , and the arrival of the cigar industry jump-started Tampa 's development and helped it to grow into an important city by the early 1900s .
Today , Tampa is a part of the metropolitan area most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area .
For U.S. Census purposes , Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater , Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area .
The four-county area is composed of roughly 2.7 million residents , making it the second largest metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) in the state , and the fourth largest in the Southeastern United States , behind Miami , Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta .
The Greater Tampa Bay area has just over 4 million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas .
The Tampa Bay Partnership and U.S. Census data showed an average annual growth of 2.47 percent , or a gain of approximately 97,000 residents per year .
Between 2000 and 2006 , the Greater Tampa Bay Market experienced a combined growth rate of 14.8 percent , growing from 3.4 million to 3.9 million and hitting the 4 million people mark on April 1 , 2007 .
A 2012 estimate shows the Tampa Bay area population to have 4,310,524 people and a 2017 projection of 4,536,854 people .
Tampa has a number of sports teams , such as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League , the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League , and the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League .
The Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball and the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League play their home games in neighboring St. Petersburg , Florida .
In 2008 , Tampa was ranked as the 5th best outdoor city by Forbes .
A 2004 survey by the NYU newspaper Washington Square News ranked Tampa as a top city for `` twenty-somethings . ''
Tampa is now ranked as a `` Gamma '' world city by Loughborough University .

when did at & t retire analog wireless
AT & T Mobility LLC branded and referred to as AT & T ( formerly Cingular Wireless LLC ) , is a wholly owned subsidiary of AT & T Inc. that provides wireless services to 107 million subscribers in the United States , including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
AT & T Mobility is the second largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States and Puerto Rico , behind Verizon Wireless , which serves 115.78 million customers as of the fourth quarter of 2012 .
AT & T Mobility is headquartered in the Lenox Park area of DeKalb Co. Georgia , just outside Atlanta .
Originally Cingular Wireless LLC from 2000 to 2007 , a joint venture between SBC Communications and BellSouth , the company acquired the old AT & T Wireless in 2004 ; SBC later acquired the original AT & T and re-branded as `` AT & T '' .
Cingular became wholly owned by AT & T in December 2006 as a result of AT & T 's acquisition of BellSouth .
In January 2007 , Cingular confirmed it would re-brand itself under the AT & T name .
Although the legal corporate name change occurred immediately , for both regulatory and brand-awareness reasons both brands were used in the company 's signage and advertising during a transition period .
The transition concluded in late June , just prior to the rollout of the Apple iPhone .
On March 20 , 2011 , AT & T Mobility announced its intention to acquire T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $ 39 billion .
If it had received government and regulatory approval , AT & T would have had more than 130 million subscribers .
However , the U.S. Department of Justice , the Federal Communications Commission , and AT & T Mobility 's competitors ( such as Sprint Nextel ) opposed the move on the grounds that it would reduce competition in the cellular communications market .
In December 2011 , in the face of both governmental and widespread consumer opposition , AT & T withdrew their offer to complete the merger .
what year did martin luther king die
Martin Luther King , Jr. ( January 15 , 1929 – April 4 , 1968 ) was an American clergyman , activist , and leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement .
He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience .
King has become a national icon in the history of American progressivism .
A Baptist minister , King became a civil rights activist early in his career .
He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) in 1957 , serving as its first president .
With the SCLC , King led an unsuccessful struggle against segregation in Albany , Georgia , in 1962 , and organized nonviolent protests in Birmingham , Alabama , that attracted national attention following television news coverage of the brutal police response .
King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington , where he delivered his `` I Have a Dream `` speech .
There , he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history .
He also established his reputation as a radical , and became an object of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's COINTELPRO for the rest of his life .
FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties , recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials , and on one occasion , mailed King a threatening anonymous letter that he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide .
On October 14 , 1964 , King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolence .
In 1965 , he and the SCLC helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches and the following year , he took the movement north to Chicago .
In the final years of his life , King expanded his focus to include poverty and the Vietnam War , alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled `` Beyond Vietnam '' .
King was planning a national occupation of Washington , D.C. , called the Poor People 's Campaign .
King was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 , in Memphis , Tennessee .
His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities .
Allegations that James Earl Ray , the man convicted of killing King , had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting , and the jury of a 1999 civil trial found Loyd Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy against King .
King was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously .
Martin Luther King , Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986 .
Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor .
A memorial statue on the National Mall was opened to the public in 2011 .
what are some animals in a tigers environment
The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest cat species , reaching a total body length of up to and weighing up to .
It is the third largest land carnivore ( behind only the polar bear and the brown bear ) .
Its most recognizable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside .
It has exceptionally stout teeth , and the canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of as much as or even .
In zoos , tigers have lived for 20 to 26 years , which also seems to be their longevity in the wild .
They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals , often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements .
This , coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .
Tigers once ranged widely across Asia , from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia .
Over the past 100 years , they have lost 93 % of their historic range , and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia .
Today , they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps .
The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by IUCN .
The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other .
Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching .
The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41 % decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s .
Tigers are among the most recognisable and popular of the world 's charismatic megafauna .
They have featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore , and continue to be depicted in modern films and literature .
Tigers appear on many flags , coats of arms , and as mascots for sporting teams .
The Bengal tiger is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh .
Who worked out the reactions that occur in the dark reactions of photosynthesis ?
The simplified internal structure of a chloroplast
Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose .
These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes .
These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them .
There are three phases to the light-independent reactions , collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation , reduction reactions , and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration .
Despite its name , this process occurs only when light is available .
Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night .
They , instead , release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves .
This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work .
what to make with linen
A linen handkerchief with pulled thread embroidery around the edges
Linen cloth recovered from Qumran Cave 1 near the Dead Sea .
Linen ( ) is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant , Linum usitatissimum .
Linen is labor-intensive to manufacture , but when it is made into garments , it is valued for its exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather .
The word `` linen '' is of West Germanic origin and cognates with the Latin name for the flax plant linum , and the earlier Greek λινόν ( linon ) .
This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English , the most notable of which is the English word line , derived from the use of a linen ( flax ) thread to determine a straight line .
Textiles in a linen weave texture , even when made of cotton , hemp and other non-flax fibers are also loosely referred to as `` linen '' .
Such fabrics generally have their own specific names other than linen ; for example , fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called Madapolam .
The collective term `` linens `` is still often used generically to describe a class of woven and even knitted bed , bath , table and kitchen textiles .
The name linens is retained because traditionally , linen was used for many of these items .
In the past , the word `` linens '' was also used to mean lightweight undergarments such as shirts , chemises , waistshirts , lingerie ( a word also cognate with linen ) , and detachable shirt collars and cuffs , which were historically made almost exclusively out of linen .
The inside cloth layer of fine composite clothing garments ( as for example jackets ) was traditionally made of linen , and this is the origin of the word lining .
Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world : their history goes back many thousands of years .
Fragments of straw , seeds , fibers , yarns , and various types of fabrics which date back to about 8000 BC have been found in Swiss lake dwellings .
Dyed flax fibers found in a prehistoric cave in Georgia suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back even earlier to 36,000 BP .
Linen was sometimes used as currency in ancient Egypt .
Egyptian mummies were wrapped in linen because it was seen as a symbol of light and purity , and as a display of wealth .
Some of these fabrics , woven from hand spun yarns , were very fine for their day , but are coarse compared to modern linen .
Today , linen is usually an expensive textile , and is produced in relatively small quantities .
It has a long `` staple '' ( individual fiber length ) relative to cotton and other natural fibers .
Many products are made of linen : aprons , bags , towels ( swimmers , bath , beach , body and wash towels ) , napkins , bed linens , linen tablecloths , runners , chair covers , and men 's & women 's wear .

who composed the Singapore national anthem
Majulah Singapura ( Onward Singapore ) is the national anthem of Singapore .
Composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore , the song was selected in 1959 as the island 's anthem when it attained self-government .
Upon full independence in 1965 , Majulah Singapura was formally adopted as Singapore 's national anthem .
By law the anthem may only be sung with its original Malay lyrics , although there exist authorized translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore 's three other official languages : English , Mandarin and Tamil .
Originally composed in the key of G major , in 2001 the national anthem was officially relaunched in the lower key of F major as this was said to allow for a `` grander and more inspiring arrangement '' .
The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day , during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the national pledge is taken .
Singaporeans are especially encouraged to sing the national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance such as at the National Day Parade , at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments , and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating .

A different ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations .
what is a r4 card
alt=Larger flashcart , shown with small card and U.S. quarter for size
Nintendo DS storage devices are devices used to store a licensed developer 's work-in-progress images , homebrew video games and downloaded commercial games ( since the Nintendo DS is not sold with a rewritable storage medium ) .
Licensed developers , however , can use a blue Intelligent Systems Nitro Emulator box to flash cards .
These devices are also known as `` flashcarts '' or `` flashcards '' .
There are two main classes of flashcarts : older devices which fit in Slot-2 ( the Game Boy Advance Game Pak slot ) and newer devices that fit in Slot-1 ( the DS Game Card slot ) .
Slot-2 ( or first-generation ) devices have been historically cheaper due to economies of scale ( inherited from their use with Game Boy Advance ) , but require a booting tool in Slot-1 in order to use the touch screen and other DS features .
Second-generation devices ( those which only use Slot-1 ) do not work with GBA homebrew , but became less expensive and easier to use , rivaling many Slot-2 devices in price .
First-generation devices include GBA flash cartridges , GBAMP CF , SuperCard , and M3 .
Second-generation devices include R4 Revolution , CycloDS , G6 Real and DS-X .
The storage device either contains flash memory or a slot for a memory card to store homebrew .
Storage devices with a memory-card slot usually have more storage capacity than flash-memory devices .
Although flash-memory capacity is usually measured in megabits ( Mb ) , memory-card capacity is usually measured in megabytes ( MB ) ( where 8 Mb is 1 MB ) .
Storage-device brands differ in their support for homebrew ; DS and Game Boy Advance ROMs ; special features ( such as ability to play media files ) ; physical size and cost .
Strictly speaking , a storage device is not necessary for DS with FlashMe installed because homebrew can be sent to the DS using WMB .
However , this is not an easily-portable method because the DS needs to be within range of a suitable Wi-Fi card .

In a suit , pain and suffering is part of the `` general damages '' section of the claimant 's claim , or , alternatively , it is an element of `` compensatory '' non-economic damages that allows recovery for the mental anguish and/or physical pain endured by the claimant as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress .
Apart from money damages awarded in trial , money damages are also given informally outside the judicial system in mediations , arbitration ( both of which may be court annexed or non litigated claims ) as well as in routine insurance settlements .
Individual claimants or those represented by lawyers often present demands to insurers to settle for money .
These demand for bodily injury compensation monies often set out damages that are similarly used in the court litigated pleadings .
Demands are usually written summaries of a claimant 's medical care and the facts which resulted in the injury .
what is a medallion guarantee
Sample of a Medallion signature guarantee stampIn
the United States and Canada , a medallion signature guarantee is a special signature guarantee for the transfer of securities .
It is a guarantee by the transferring financial institution that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any forgery .
Signature guarantees protect shareholders by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible investor losses .
They also limit the liability of the transfer agent who accepts the certificates .
Different institutions have different policies as to what type of identification they require to provide the guarantee and whether they charge a fee for such service ( usually nominal if any ) .
Most institutions will not guarantee a signature of someone who has not already been their customer .
A medallion signature guarantee is not the same as an acknowledgment by a notary public , in the sense that a `` signature guarantee '' is a certification by the institution that the signature is authentic , and an acknowledgment is a certification by a notary public attesting that the signer signed a document voluntarily .
Some banks may no longer provide this service , however , many still do as well as other financial institutions such as a Savings and Loans and Credit Unions .
At their sole discretion , these institutions may still decline to provide the Medallion Signature Guarantees .
When US citizens are abroad , some financial institutions may accept United States Embassy Seals , in place of the Medallion Signature Guarantee Stamp .
who destroyed street cars
Pacific Electric Railway streetcars stacked at a junkyard on Terminal Island , Los Angeles County , California , March 1956
The General Motors streetcar conspiracy ( also known as the Great American streetcar scandal ) refers to allegations and convictions in relation to a program by General Motors ( GM ) and other companies who purchased and then dismantled streetcar and electric train systems in many American cities .
Between 1936 and 1950 , National City Lines and Pacific City Lines —with investment from GM , Firestone Tire , Standard Oil of California , Phillips Petroleum , Mack Trucks , and the Federal Engineering Corporation—bought over 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities including Baltimore , Newark , Los Angeles , New York City , Oakland and San Diego and converted them into bus operation .
Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies .
Some suggest that this program played a key role in the decline of public transit in cities across the United States ; notably Edwin J. Quinby , who first drew attention to the program in 1946 , and then Bradford C. Snell , an anti-trust attorney for the United States Senate whose controversial 1974 testimony to a Senate inquiry brought the issue to national awareness .
Both Quinby and Snell argued that the deliberate destruction of streetcars was part of a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency .
Others say that independent economic factors brought about changes in the transit system , including the Great Depression , the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , labor unrest , market forces , rapidly increasing traffic congestion , urban sprawl , taxation policies that favored private vehicle ownership , and general enthusiasm for the automobile .
One writer on the subject has suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic conspiracy theory thinking , bordering on paranoid delusions saying `` Clearly , GM waged a war on electric traction .
It was indeed an all out assault , but by no means the single reason for the failure of rapid transit .
Also , it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government contributed significantly to the elimination of electric traction . ''
Only a small handful of U.S. cities have surviving effective rail-based urban transport systems based on streetcars or trams , including Newark , Philadelphia , San Francisco , Pittsburgh , and Boston ; others are re-introducing them .
The story has been explored several times in print , film and other media , notably in Who Framed Roger Rabbit , Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia .

American colonial architecture includes several building design styles associated with the colonial period of the United States , including First Period English ( late-medieval ) , French Colonial , Spanish Colonial , Dutch Colonial and Georgian .
These styles are associated with the houses , churches and government buildings of the period from about 1600 through the 19th century .
who wrote the song in the mood
`` In the Mood '' is a big band era # 1 hit recorded by American bandleader Glenn Miller .
It topped the charts in 1940 in the U.S. and one year later was featured in the movie Sun Valley Serenade .
In 1999 , National Public Radio ( NPR ) included the 1939 Glenn Miller recording on RCA Bluebird on the NPR 100 , the list of `` The 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century '' .

The NEPTUNE Canada project is the world’s first regional-scale underwater ocean observatory that plugs directly into the Internet .
Since December 2009 , it has allowed people to `` surf '' the seafloor while ocean scientists run deep-water experiments from labs and universities around the world .
Along with its sister project , VENUS , NEPTUNE offers a unique approach to ocean science .
Traditionally , ocean scientists have relied on infrequent ship cruises or space-based satellites to carry out their research , while the NEPTUNE project uses a remotely operated crawler .
what is a 10 '' Vinyl Release
A gramophone record , commonly known as a phonograph record ( in American English ) , vinyl record ( in reference to vinyl , the material most commonly used after about 1950 ) , or colloquially , `` a record '' , is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed , modulated spiral groove .
The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc .
Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches ( 12-inch , 10-inch , 7-inch , etc . ) , the rotational speed at which they are played ( `` 33 rpm `` , `` 78 '' , `` 45 '' , etc . ) , their time capacity ( `` long playing '' ) , their reproductive accuracy , or `` fidelity `` ( `` high fidelity '' , `` Orthophonic '' , `` full-range '' , etc . ) , and the number of channels of audio provided ( `` mono `` , `` stereo `` , `` quadraphonic `` , etc . ) .
Phonograph records were the primary medium used for music reproduction for most of the 20th century , replacing the phonograph cylinder , with which it had co-existed , by the 1920s .
By the late 1980s , digital media had gained a larger market share , and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991 .
They continue to be manufactured and sold in the 21st century .
In 2008 , nearly 2.9 million units shipped , the most in any year since 1998 and the format has continued to slowly regain popularity .
They are especially used by DJs and audiophiles for many types of music .
As of 2013 , vinyl records continue to be used for distribution .
what are they like in tropical grassland in plant
Grassland in the Santa Rosa Plateau , California .
Grassland in the Antelope Valley , California
The Konza tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas .
A grassland in the Philippines .
An Inner Mongolian grassland in the People 's Republic of China
Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses ( Poaceae ) , however sedge ( Cyperaceae ) and rush ( Juncaceae ) families can also be found .
Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica .
In temperate latitudes , such as northwestern Europe and the Great Plains and California in North America , native grasslands are dominated by perennial bunch grass species , whereas in warmer climates annual species form a greater component of the vegetation .
Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth .
For example there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications ( subdivisions ) of the temperate grasslands , savannas , and shrublands biome ( ' ecosystem ' ) , which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth 's surface .
what religions used henna
Henna ( Lawsonia inermis , also called henna tree ) or Hina is a flowering plant , the sole species in the genus Lawsonia in the family Lythraceae .
The English name `` henna '' comes from the Arabic ( ALA-LC : ḥinnāʾ / pronounced ) or colloquially , loosely pronounced .
The name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant , and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes .
Henna has been used since antiquity to dye skin , hair , and fingernails , as well as fabrics including Silk , wool and leather .
Additionally , the name is misused for other skin and hair dyes , such as black henna or neutral henna , which are not derived from the plant .
what is `` thin film '' technology
A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer ( monolayer ) to several micrometers in thickness .
Electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film construction .
A familiar application of thin films is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface .
The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors .
A very-thin-film coating ( less than a nanometer thick ) is used to produce two-way mirrors .
The performance of optical coatings ( e.g . antireflective , or AR , coatings ) are typically enhanced when the thin-film coating consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices .
Similarly , a periodic structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions .
Work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for use as computer memory .
It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals , via thin-film drug delivery .
Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries .
Thin films are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells .
Ceramic thin films are in wide use .
The relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection of substrate materials against corrosion , oxidation and wear .
In particular , the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude .
Research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials , called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides , which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive , stable , and environmentally benign .

what zones are tropical
World map with the intertropical zone highlighted in red .
Tropical climate zones of the Earth where all twelve months have mean temperatures above 18 °C ( 64 °F ) .
The tropics is a region of the Earth surrounding the Equator .
It is limited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere at approximately N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere at S ; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth .
The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone ( see geographical zone ) .
The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year .
The tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of Earth , the middle latitudes and the polar regions on either side of the equatorial zone .

when did playhouse square reopen ?
PlayhouseSquare , in the Cleveland Theater District in downtown Cleveland , Ohio , is the second-largest theater complex in the United States , second only to New York City 's Lincoln Center ) .
Constructed in a span of 19 months in the early 1920s , the theaters were subsequently closed down , but were revived through a grassroots effort .
Their renovation and reopening helped usher in a new era of downtown revitalization in Cleveland , and was called `` one of the top ten successes in Cleveland history . ''
when does air bag deploy
The driver and passenger front airbags , after having been deployed , in a British Peugeot 306 car .
An airbag is a vehicle safety device .
It is an occupant restraint system consisting of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision .
Its purpose is to cushion occupants during a crash and provide protection to their bodies when they strike interior objects such as the steering wheel or a window .
Modern vehicles may contain multiple airbag modules in various side and frontal locations of the passenger seating positions , and sensors may deploy one or more airbags in an impact zone at variable rates based on the type , angle and severity of impact ; the airbag is designed to only inflate in moderate to severe frontal crashes .
Airbags are normally designed with the intention of supplementing the protection of an occupant who is correctly restrained with a seatbelt .
Most designs are inflated through pyrotechnic means and can only be operated once .
Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side impact vehicle impact .
The first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s with limited success .
Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag , and a front passenger airbag as well on some cars ; and many modern vehicles now include four or more units .
who gets a w2 form
IRS tax forms are used for taxpayers and tax-exempt organizations to report financial information to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) of the United States .
They are used to report income , calculate taxes to be paid to the federal government of the United States , and disclose other information as required by the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) .
There are over 800 various forms and schedules .
The best-known of these is Form 1040 used by individuals .
what is a class c driver 's license
In the United States , driver 's licenses are issued by each individual state ( including Washington , D.C. and territories ) , rather than the federal government because of the political concept of federalism .
Drivers are normally required to obtain a license from their state of residence and all states recognize each other 's licenses for temporary visitors subject to normal age requirements .
A state may also suspend an individual 's driving privilege within its borders for traffic violations .
Many states share a common system of license classes , with some exceptions , and commercial license classes are standardized by federal regulation at 49 CFR part 383 .
what are some chinese inventions
China has been the source of many inventions , including the Four Great Inventions : papermaking , the compass , gunpowder , and printing ( both woodblock and movable type ) .
The list below contains these and other inventions .
The Chinese invented technologies involving mechanics , hydraulics , and mathematics applied to horology , metallurgy , astronomy , agriculture , engineering , music theory , craftsmanship , nautics , and warfare .
By the Warring States Period ( 403–221 BC ) , they had advanced metallurgic technology , including the blast furnace and cupola furnace , while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty ( 202 BC – AD 220 ) .
A sophisticated economic system in China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty ( 960–1279 ) .
The invention of gunpowder by the 10th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance , land mine , naval mine , hand cannon , exploding cannonballs , multistage rocket , and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads .
With the navigational aid of the 11th-century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st-century sternpost rudder , premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa and Egypt .
In water-powered clockworks , the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century .
They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats .
The contemporaneous Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures represent the oldest Neolithic cultures of China and were formed around 7000 BC .
Some of the first inventions of Neolithic , prehistoric China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives , stone hoes and spades , the cultivation of millet , rice and the soybean , the refinement of sericulture , the building of rammed earth structures with lime -plastered house floors , the creation of the potter 's wheel , the creation of pottery with cord-mat-basket designs , the creation of pottery tripods and pottery steamers , and the development of ceremonial vessels and scapulimancy for purposes of divination .
Francesca Bray argues that the domestication of the ox and buffalo during the Longshan culture ( c. 3000–c . 2000 BC ) period , the absence of Longshan-era irrigation or high-yield crops , full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land cereal crops which gave high yields `` only when the soil was carefully cultivated , '' suggest that the plow was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang Dynasty ( c. 1600–c . 1050 BC ) .
With later inventions such as the multiple-tube seed drill and heavy moldboard iron plow , China 's agricultural output could sustain a much larger population .
For the purposes of this list , inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China , and as such does not include foreign technologies which the Chinese acquired through contact , such as the windmill from the Middle East or the telescope from Early modern Europe .
It also does not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese , such as the odometer and chain pump .
Scientific , mathematic or natural discoveries , changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations can not be regarded as inventions and do not appear on the list .
What are the primary components of globalization that affect how the practice of medicine takes place in the U.S. ?
Gross domestic product in 2011 US dollars per capita , adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity ( log scale ) from 1860 to 2011 , with population ( disk area ) for the US ( yellow ) , UK ( orange ) , Japan ( red ) , China ( red ) , and India ( blue ) .
Globalization ( or globalisation—see spelling differences ) is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views , products , ideas , and other aspects of culture .
Put in simple terms , globalization refers to processes that promote world-wide exchanges of national and cultural resources .
Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure , including the rise of the Internet , are major factors in globalization , generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities .
Though several scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times , others trace its history long before the European age of discovery and voyages to the New World .
Some even trace the origins to the third millennium BCE .
Since the beginning of the 20th century , the pace of globalization has intensified at a rapid rate , especially during the Post Cold War era .
The term globalization has been in increasing use since the mid-1980s and especially since the mid-1990s .
In 2000 , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) identified four basic aspects of globalization : trade and transactions , capital and investment movements , migration and movement of people and the dissemination of knowledge .
Further , environmental challenges such as climate change , cross-boundary water and air pollution , and over-fishing of the ocean are linked with globalization .
Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization , economics , socio-cultural resources , and the natural environment .

who sung the banana boat song
`` Day-O ( The Banana Boat Song ) '' is a traditional Jamaican mento folk song , the best-known version of which was sung by Harry Belafonte and an alternate version interspersed with another Jamaican folksong , Hill and Gully Rider , by Dame Shirley Bassey .
Despite the song 's mento influences , `` Day-O ( The Banana Boat Song ) '' is widely known as an example of calypso music .
It is a work song , from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading bananas onto ships .
Daylight has come , the shift is over and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home .
when did wwi begin
World War I ( WWI ) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918 .
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939 , and the First World War or World War I thereafter .
It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) .
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers .
Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
Within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .
While the Russians mobilised , the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France , providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany .
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans .
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai .
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916 .
In Russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers .
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front , the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches .
Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 .
The war ended in victory for the Allies .
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
By the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .

what two empires fought to control afghanistan
Afghanistan ( ; ; ) , officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , is a landlocked sovereign state forming part of South Asia , Central Asia , and to some extent Western Asia .
It has a population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately , making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world .
It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and the east , Iran in the west , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north , and China in the far northeast .
Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration .
Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle Paleolithic .
Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BCE .
Sitting at an important geostrategic location that connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent , the land has been home to various peoples through the ages and witnessed many military campaigns , notably by Alexander the Great , Genghis Khan , and in modern era Western forces .
The land also served as a source from which the Greco-Bactrians , Kushans , Hephthalites , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khiljis , Timurids , Mughals , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires .
The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan begins in 1709 , when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani 's rise to power in 1747 .
In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the `` Great Game `` between the British and Russian empires .
Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War , King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives .
During the Cold War , after the withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947 , the United States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan , which led to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million Afghans lost their lives .
This was followed by the 1990s civil war , the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government and the 2001–present war .
In December 2001 , the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration .
Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world 's most dangerous countries , including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers .
While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan , terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban -led insurgency , which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks .
According to the United Nations , the insurgents were responsible for 80 % of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012 .
what triggered the civil war
The American Civil War ( ACW ) , also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ) , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ) .
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
Foreign powers did not intervene .
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure , the Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began .
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories .
Lincoln won , but before his inauguration on March 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy .
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal .
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy .
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America .
Hostilities began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina .
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the Confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62 .
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention .
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
To the west , by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River .
In 1863 , Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg .
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864 .
In the Western Theater , William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way .
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond , the Confederate capital .
The defending Confederate army failed , leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
Railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
The mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I .
It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old , and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 .
what makes up cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold ( COGS ) refer to the inventory costs of those goods a business has sold during a particular period .
Costs are associated with particular goods using one of several formulas , including specific identification , first-in first-out ( FIFO ) , or average cost .
Costs include all costs of purchase , costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition .
Costs of goods made by the business include material , labor , and allocated overhead .
The costs of those goods not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until the inventory is sold or written down in value .
what is a store confectioner
Freak Lunchbox candy store in Halifax , Nova Scotia
A confectionery store ( more commonly referred to as a sweet shop in the United Kingdom , a candy store in the North America , or a lolly shop in Australia ) sells confectionery and is usually targeted to children .
Most confectionery stores are filled with an assortment of sweets far larger than a grocer or convenience store could accommodate .
They often offer a selection of old fashioned treats , and sweets from different countries .
Very often unchanged in layout since their inception , confectioneries are known for their warming and nostalgic feel .
The village of Pateley Bridge claims to have the oldest confectionery store in England .

what species does johnson grass in oklahoma belong to ?
Oklahoma ( ) ( Pawnee : Uukuhuúwa , Cayuga : Gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state located in West South Central United States .
Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States .
The state 's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma , meaning `` red people '' , and it is known informally by its nickname , The Sooner State .
Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16 , 1907 , Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union .
Its residents are known as Oklahomans or , informally `` Okies '' , and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City .
A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agriculture , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology .
It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation , ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth .
Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas .
With small mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S . Interior Highlands —a region especially prone to severe weather .
In addition to having a prevalence of English , German , Scottish , Irish and Native American ancestry , more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma , second only to California .
Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans .
what are tires made of
Stacked and standing car tires
A tire ( or tyre ) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel 's rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance .
Most tires , such as those for automobiles and bicycles , provide traction between the vehicle and the road while providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock .
The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber , natural rubber , fabric and wire , along with carbon black and other chemical compounds .
They consist of a tread and a body .
The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air .
Before rubber was developed , the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear .
Early rubber tires were solid ( not pneumatic ) .
Today , the majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures , comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion .
Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles , including cars , bicycles , motorcycles , trucks , earthmovers , and aircraft .
Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars , and solid rubber ( or other polymer ) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications , such as some casters , carts , lawnmowers , and wheelbarrows .
who killed general warren in bunker hill
Dr. Joseph Warren ( June 11 , 1741 – June 17 , 1775 ) was an American doctor who played a leading role in American Patriot organizations in Boston in early days of the American Revolution , eventually serving as president of the revolutionary Massachusetts Provincial Congress .
Warren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18 , 1775 , to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of Concord and arrest rebel leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams .
Warren participated in the next day 's Battles of Lexington and Concord , which are commonly considered to be the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War .
Warren had been commissioned a Major General in the colony 's militia shortly before the June 17 , 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill .
Rather than exercising his rank , Warren served in the battle as a private soldier , and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed 's Hill .
His death , immortalized in John Trumbull 's painting , The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker 's Hill , June 17 , 1775 , galvanized the rebel forces , and he has been memorialized in many place names in the United States .
what are organic semiconductors and what is concept of homo and lumo in organic semiconductor
STM image of self-assembled supramolecular chains of the organic semiconductor Quinacridone on Graphite .
An organic semiconductor is an organic material with semiconductor properties , that is , with an electrical conductivity between that of insulators and that of metals .
Single molecules , short chain ( oligomers ) and organic polymers can be semiconductive .
Semiconducting small molecules ( aromatic hydrocarbons ) include the polycyclic aromatic compounds pentacene , anthracene , and rubrene .
Polymeric organic semiconductors include poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) , poly ( p-phenylene vinylene ) , as well as polyacetylene and its derivatives .
There are two major overlapping classes of organic semiconductors .
These are organic charge-transfer complexes and various linear-backbone conductive polymers derived from polyacetylene .
Linear backbone organic semiconductors include polyacetylene itself and its derivatives polypyrrole , and polyaniline .
At least locally , charge-transfer complexes often exhibit similar conduction mechanisms to inorganic semiconductors .
Such mechanisms arise from the presence of hole and electron conduction layers separated by a band gap .
While such classic mechanisms are important locally , as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors , tunnelling , localized states , mobility gaps , and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction , particularly in polyacetylenes .
Like inorganic semiconductors , organic semiconductors can be doped .
Organic semiconductors susceptible to doping such as polyaniline ( Ormecon ) and are also known as organic metals .
Typical current carriers in organic semiconductors are holes and electrons in π-bonds .
Almost all organic solids are insulators .
But when their constituent molecules have π-conjugate systems , electrons can move via π-electron cloud overlaps , especially by hopping , tunnelling and related mechanisms .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalocyanine salt crystals are examples of this type of organic semiconductor .
Mainly due to low mobility , even unpaired electrons may be stable in charge-transfer complexes .
Such unpaired electrons can function as current carriers .
This type of semiconductor is also obtained by pairing an electron donor molecule with an electron acceptor molecule .
where do women ejeculation exactly coming from
Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid by human females from the paraurethral ducts through and around the female urethra during or before an orgasm .
It is also known colloquially as gushing or squirting , although these are considered to be different phenomena in some research publications .
The exact source and nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals , which is also related to doubts over the existence of the G-Spot .
who won the women 's world cup
The FIFA Women 's World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the senior women 's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body .
The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1991 .
Japan won the 2011 tournament in a penalty shootout .
The current format of the tournament involves 16 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation ( s ) over a period of about three weeks ; – this phase is often called the World Cup Finals .
A qualification phase , which currently takes place over the preceding three years , is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation ( s ) .
The FIFA Women 's World Cup is recognized as the most important International competition in women 's football and is played amongst women 's national football teams of the member states of FIFA , the sport 's global governing body .
The first Women 's World Cup tournament , named the Women 's World Championship , was held in 1991 , sixty-one years after the men 's first FIFA World Cup tournament in 1930 .
The six World Cup tournaments have been won by four different national teams .
The next World Cup will be hosted by Canada in 2015 .
what problems does jamal face in the book Scorpion
Scorpions is a young adult novel written by Walter Dean Myers , first published in the United States by Harper & Row on June 20 , 1988 .
Who do they say the Son of Man ...
Front page of a 17th century Hebrew Bible by Joseph Athias , now at Beth Hatefutsoth , Israel
'Son of man ' is the translation of various Hebrew and Greek phrases used in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament .
It has diverse meanings , ranging from a normal human being to a prophesied eternal , divine ruler .
The Hebrew expression `` son of man '' ( בן–אדם i.e . ben-'adam ) appears one hundred and seven times in the Hebrew Bible .
This is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular but is used mostly in Ezekiel ( 93 times ) and 14 times elsewhere .
In thirty two cases the phrase appears in intermediate plural form `` sons of men '' , i.e . human beings .
As generally interpreted by Jews , it denotes humankind generally .
In the Koine Greek of the New Testament , `` the son of man '' is invariably used as `` ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου '' with a definite article .
The use of the definite article in `` the son of man '' in the Christian gospels is novel , and before its use there , no records of its use in any of the surviving Greek documents of antiquity exist .
Geza Vermes has stated that `` the Son of man '' in the Christian gospels is unrelated to Hebrew Bible usages .
In Christian usage , unlike the Son of God title , which has been an essential element of Christian creeds since the Apostolic age , the proclamation of `` Jesus as the Son of man '' has never been an article of faith in Christianity .
The interpretation of the use of `` the Son of man '' in the New Testament has remained challenging and after 150 years of debate no consensus on the issue has emerged among scholars .
when to hunt red fox
Master of foxhounds leads the field from Powderham Castle in Devon , England , with the hounds in front .
Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking , chase , and sometimes killing of a fox , traditionally a red fox , by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds , and a group of unarmed followers led by a master of foxhounds , who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback .
Fox hunting originated in the form practised until recently in the United Kingdom in the 16th century , but is practised all over the world , including in Australia , Canada , France , Ireland , Italy and the United States .
In Australia , the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms similar to spotlighting or deer hunting .
In much of the world hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons ( e.g. , deer hunting with bow and arrow ) ; in Britain and Ireland , `` hunting '' without qualification implies fox hunting ( or other forms of hunting with hounds- beagling , stag hunting , mink hunting , drag hunting or hunting the clean boot ) as described here .
The sport is controversial , particularly in the UK , where it was banned in Scotland in 2002 , and in England and Wales in November 2004 ( law enforced from February 2005 ) , though shooting foxes as vermin remained legal .
Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control , while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary .
when did cigarette commercials get banned
Tobacco advertising is the advertising of tobacco products or use ( typically cigarette smoking ) by the tobacco industry through a variety of media including sponsorship , particularly of sporting events .
It is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing .
Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries .

Inferno ( Italian for `` Hell `` ) is the first part of Dante Alighieri 's 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy .
It is followed by Purgatorio and Paradiso .
It is an allegory telling of the journey of Dante through Hell , guided by the Roman poet Virgil .
In the poem , Hell is depicted as nine circles of suffering located within the Earth .
Allegorically , the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul towards God , with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin .
who owns smirnoff

what are the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress about
The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress ( also known as the Declaration of Colonial Rights , or the Declaration of Rights ) , was a statement adopted by the First Continental Congress on October 14 , 1774 , in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament .
The Declaration outlined colonial objections to the Intolerable Acts , listed a colonial bill of rights , and provided a detailed list of grievances .
It was similar to the Declaration of Rights and Grievances , passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier .
The Declaration concluded with an outline of Congress 's plans : to enter into a boycott of British trade ( the Continental Association ) until their grievances were redressed , to publish addresses to the people of Great Britain and British America , and to send a petition to the King .
what is a low pulse rate
Pulse pressure is the pressure that is felt when feeling the pulse .
Measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) , the pressure difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures is the pressure change to create the pulse , which is the pulse pressure .
If resting blood pressure is ( systolic/diastolic ) 120/80 millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) , pulse pressure is 40 .

what is a bad beat in poker
In poker , bad beat is a subjective term for a hand in which a player with what appear to be strong cards nevertheless loses .
It most often occurs where one player bets the clearly stronger hand and their opponent makes a poor call that eventually `` hits '' and wins .
There is no consensus among poker players as to what exactly constitutes a bad beat and often players will disagree about whether a particular hand was a bad beat .
where do goldfish live
The goldfish ( Carassius auratus auratus ) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes .
It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated , and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish .
A relatively small member of the carp family ( which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp ) , the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colorful carp ( Carassius auratus ) native to east Asia .
It was first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago , and several distinct breeds have since been developed .
Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size , body shape , fin configuration and coloration ( various combinations of white , yellow , orange , red , brown , and black are known ) .
what part of beef are rouladen cut from ?
Uncooked Rouladen
Rouladen ( or Rinderroulade , singular : roulade ) is a German meat roulade usually consisting of bacon , onions , mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then cooked .
In some countries , the roulade is also known as `` beef olive '' .
Beef or veal is used as meat though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version was probably venison or pork , and pork is still popular in some areas .
The beef rouladen as we know them today have become popular over the last century .
The cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut .
The more expensive version would be the round steak , also known as rump steak .
The meat is cut into large , thin slices .
The filling is a mixture of smoked and cooked pork belly , chopped onions and chopped pickles ( gurken ) which is at times varied by adding minced meat , sausage meat , pine nuts and mustard .
The mixture varies from region to region .
Rouladen are traditionally served for dinner .
Red wine is often served with this dish .
where does cellular respiration occur
Typical eukaryotic cell .
Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , and then release waste products .
The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products .
Respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity .
Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction .
The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body , most of which are redox reactions themselves .
Although technically , cellular respiration is a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell .
This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps .
While the overall reaction is a combustion reaction , no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reaction .
Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and a common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O2 ) .
The energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy , including biosynthesis , locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes .
what are some countries
Countries by 2011 GDP ( nominal ) according to the CIA World Factbook .
This article includes a list of countries in the world sorted by their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year .
The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates .
Several economies which are not considered to be countries ( world , the EU , and some dependent territories ) are included in the lists because they appear in the sources .
These economies are not ranked in the charts here , but are listed where applicable .
The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries , and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's currency .
Such fluctuations may change a country 's ranking from one year to the next , even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population .
Therefore these figures should be used with caution .
Some countries/regions may have citizens which are on average wealthy .
These countries/regions could appear in this list as having a small GDP .
This would be because the country/region listed has a small population , and therefore small total economy ; the GDP is calculated as the population times the wealth per capita .
Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries .
( See List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) )
PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem , but has its own drawbacks ; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade , and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP .
On the whole , PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures .
The first list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division for 2011 .
The second list largely includes data ( estimate ) compiled by the International Monetary Fund for 2012 .
The third list shows the World Bank 's mostly 2011 estimates , and the fourth list includes mostly 2012 estimates from the CIA World Factbook .
what is a lapping machine
Lapping is a machining process , in which two surfaces are rubbed together with an abrasive between them , by hand movement or by way of a machine .
This can take two forms .
The first type of lapping ( traditionally called grinding ) , typically involves rubbing a brittle material such as glass against a surface such as iron or glass itself ( also known as the `` lap '' or grinding tool ) with an abrasive such as aluminum oxide , jeweller 's rouge , optician 's rouge , emery , silicon carbide , diamond , etc. , in between them .
This produces microscopic conchoidal fractures as the abrasive rolls about between the two surfaces and removes material from both .
The other form of lapping involves a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap , which is `` charged '' with the abrasive .
The lap is then used to cut a harder material—the workpiece .
The abrasive embeds within the softer material which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material .
Taken to a finer limit , this will produce a polished surface such as with a polishing cloth on an automobile , or a polishing cloth or polishing pitch upon glass or steel .
Taken to the ultimate limit , with the aid of accurate interferometry and specialized polishing machines or skilled hand polishing , lensmakers can produce surfaces that are flat to better than 30 nanometers .
This is one twentieth of the wavelength of light from the commonly used 632.8 nm helium neon laser light source .
Surfaces this flat can be molecularly bonded ( optically contacted ) by bringing them together under the right conditions .
( This is not the same as the wringing effect of Johansson blocks , although it is similar ) .
who said dallas cowboys were america 's team

what year did ford taper the pickup bed
Dodge B Series utility circa 1950 , driven by Albert Namatjira
A pickup truck or pick-up , often simply referred to as a pickup , is a light motor vehicle with an open-top , rear cargo area ( bed ) .
In North America , the term pickup is used for light trucks with a lighter duty chassis and factory built , integrated bed , as well as for coupé utility vehicles , often based on a personal car chassis , but also often on a special dedicated chassi for such use .
Some countries have their own terms similar to pickup , such as ute in Australia and New Zealand , or bakkie in South Africa .
Large pickup trucks are somewhat rare in Europe , where vans and light lorries are commonly used for similar roles .
What are the two initials of the first US president to resign from office
The President of the United States of America ( POTUS ) is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and charges him with the execution of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory , and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers , with the advice and consent of the Senate .
The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances .
Since the founding of the United States , the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially and each modern president , despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills , is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States .
The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world .
The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term , and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers , the other being the Vice President of the United States .
The Twenty-second Amendment , adopted in 1951 , prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term .
It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president , or acting president , for more than two years of another person 's term as president .
In all , 43 individuals have served 55 four-year terms .
On January 20 , 2009 , Barack Obama became the 44th and current president .
On November 6 , 2012 , he was re-elected and is scheduled to serve until January 20 , 2017 .

what are the rivers in india
Map of the major rivers , lakes , and reservoirs in India
Map showing rivers and flood prone areas in India
Rivers of India play an important role in the lives of the Indian people .
The river systems provide irrigation , potable water , cheap transportation , electricity , and the livelihoods for a large number of people all over the country and to rural areas .
This easily explains why nearly all the major cities of India are located by the banks of rivers .
The rivers also have an important role in Hindu mythology and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country .
Seven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India .
Most of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal ; however , some of the rivers whose courses take them through the western part of the country and towards the east of the state of Himachal Pradesh empty into the Arabian Sea .
Parts of Ladakh , northern parts of the Aravlli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert have inland drainage .
Dr.Francis Buchanan surveyed the courses of the rivers of India along with their tributaries and branches in 1810-11 AD and presented a minute account of it .
The shifting of the courses and bed over the centuries is very remarkable .
Many of the channels mentioned in that survey have now become dead , dried or even extinct .
All major rivers of India originate from one of the three main watersheds :
The Himalaya and the Karakoram ranges
Vindhya and Satpura ranges and Chotanagpur plateau in central India
Sahyadri or Western Ghats in western India
What are the fundamentals of Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates
The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states in the mid-20th century .
The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation-states .
Preparing to rebuild the international economic system as World War II was still raging , 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , United States , for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference .
The delegates deliberated during 1–22 July 1944 , and signed the Agreement on its final day .
Setting up a system of rules , institutions , and procedures to regulate the international monetary system , the planners at Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , which today is part of the World Bank Group .
These organizations became operational in 1945 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement .
The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U.S. dollar and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments .
On 15 August 1971 , the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US $ to gold .
This brought the Bretton Woods system to an end and saw the dollar become fiat currency .
This action , referred to as the Nixon shock , created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states .
At the same time , many fixed currencies ( such as GBP , for example ) , also became free floating .

what is a good credit score
A credit score is a numerical expression based on a statistical analysis of a person 's credit files , to represent the creditworthiness of that person .
A credit score is primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit bureaus .
Lenders , such as banks and credit card companies , use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt .
Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan , at what interest rate , and what credit limits .
Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue .
The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system .
Credit scoring is not limited to banks .
Other organizations , such as mobile phone companies , insurance companies , landlords , and government departments employ the same techniques .
Credit scoring also has a lot of overlap with data mining , which uses many similar techniques .
These techniques combine thousands of factors but they are more or less similar or the same .
what is a base SI unit
The seven SI base units and the interdependency of their definitions : for example , to extract the definition of the metre from the speed of light , the definition of the second must be known while the ampere and candela are both dependent on the definition of energy which in turn is defined in terms of length , mass and time .
The International System of Units ( SI ) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units are derived .
These SI base units and their physical quantities are:
metre for length ( US English : meter )
kilogram for mass ( note : not the gram )
second for time
ampere for electric current
kelvin for temperature
candela for luminous intensity
mole for the amount of substance .
The SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology .
However , in a given realization of these units they may well be interdependent , i.e . defined in terms of each other .
The names of SI units are written in lowercase characters ( the 'degree Celsius ' meets this rule , as 'degree ' is the unit , and 'Celsius ' is a modifier ) .
The symbols of units are written in lowercase ( e.g . metre has the symbol m ) , except that symbols for units named after persons are written with an initial capital letter ( e.g. , the hertz has the uppercase symbol Hz ) .
Many other units , such as the litre ( US English : liter ) , are formally not part of the SI , but are accepted for use with SI .

what is 9/11 bombings
The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as September 11 , September 11th , or 9/11 ) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks launched by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States in New York City and the Washington , D.C. area on September 11 , 2001 .
Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks .
Two of those planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in New York City .
Within two hours , both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the WTC complex , as well as major damage to ten other large surrounding structures .
A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense ) , leading to a partial collapse in its western side .
The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was targeted at the United States Capitol in Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers .
In total , almost 3,000 people died in the attacks , including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes .
Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda .
Although the group 's leader , Osama bin Laden , initially denied any involvement , in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel , the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , and sanctions against Iraq as motives for the attacks .
The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had harbored al-Qaeda .
Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers .
Having evaded capture for years , bin Laden was located and killed by U.S. forces in May 2011 .
The destruction of the Twin Towers and other properties caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets .
Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002 , and the Pentagon was repaired within a year .
Numerous memorials have been constructed , including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York , the Pentagon Memorial , and the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania .
After a lengthy delay , the One World Trade Center is expected to be completed at Ground Zero in New York City in 2013 .

what are social security taxes
In the United States , Social Security refers to the Old-Age , Survivors , and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) federal program .
The original Social Security Act ( 1935 ) and the current version of the Act , as amended , encompass several social welfare and social insurance programs .
Social Security is primarily funded through dedicated payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax ( FICA ) .
Tax deposits are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund , the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund , the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund , or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund which comprise the Social Security Trust Fund .
Upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43 % of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years .
According to economist Martin Feldstein , the combined spending for all social insurance programs in 2003 constituted 37 % of government expenditure and 7 % of the gross domestic product .
Social Security is currently estimated to keep roughly 40 percent of all Americans age 65 or older out of poverty .

when did charles dickens live
Charles John Huffam Dickens ( ; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic .
He created some of the world 's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period .
During his life , his works enjoyed unprecedented fame , and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars .
His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular .
Born in Portsmouth , England , Dickens left school to work in a factory after his father was thrown into debtors ' prison .
Although he had little formal education , his early impoverishment drove him to succeed .
Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , 5 novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .
Dickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers .
Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society .
His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication .
The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback .
For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens went on to improve the character with positive lineaments .
Fagin in Oliver Twist apparently mirrors the famous fence Ikey Solomon ; His caricature of Leigh Hunt in the figure of Mr Skimpole in Bleak House was likewise toned down on advice from some of his friends , as they read episodes .
In the same novel , both Lawrence Boythorne and Mooney the beadle are drawn from real life – Boythorne from Walter Savage Landor and Mooney from 'Looney ' , a beadle at Salisbury Square .
His plots were carefully constructed , and Dickens often wove in elements from topical events into his narratives .
Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers .
Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age .
His 1843 novella , A Christmas Carol , is one of the most influential works ever written , and it remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre .
His creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to G. K. Chesterton and George Orwell —for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism .
On the other hand Oscar Wilde , Henry James and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth , loose writing , and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism .

The process was long and tenuous in many countries , and many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals although , the efforts of these movements did lead to improvements in the legal rights of previously oppressed groups of people .
The main aim of the civil rights movement included , and include , ensuring that the rights of all people are equally protected by the law , including the rights of minorities .
Civil rights movements ranging from the global LGBT rights movement to the global Women 's rights movement to various racial minority rights movements around the world continue .

what where the most important factors that led to the defeat of the democrates in 1968 ?
The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 5 , 1968 .
The Republican nominee , former Vice-President Richard Nixon , won the election over the Democratic nominee , incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey .
Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities , torn by riots and crime .
Analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years .
Coming four years after Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won in a historic landslide , the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a Republican elected for the first time in twelve years .
It was a wrenching national experience , conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation , the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses , and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again .
The election featured the strongest third party effort since 1912 by former Alabama Governor George Wallace , a Democrat .
Because Wallace 's campaign opposed federal intervention in the South to end school segregation , he carried the Deep South and ran well in ethnic industrial districts in the North .
This was the last election in which New York had the most votes in the electoral college ( 43 votes ) .
After the 1970 census , California gained the most electoral votes and has remained the most populous state since then .
This is the latest election where a presidential ticket won without carrying the vice presidential candidate 's home state .

what are the colors of a rainbow
Double rainbow and supernumerary rainbows on the inside of the primary arc .
The shadow of the photographer 's head on the bottom marks the centre of the rainbow circle ( antisolar point ) .
A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection of light in water droplets in the Earth 's atmosphere , resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky .
It takes the form of a multicoloured arc .
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun .
In a `` primary rainbow '' , the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side .
This rainbow is caused by light being refracted while entering a droplet of water , then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it .
In a double rainbow , a second arc is seen outside the primary arc , and has the order of its colours reversed , red facing toward the other one , in both rainbows .
This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets .
when did the UK Labour Government replace the Conservative Government ?
The Conservative Party , officially the Conservative and Unionist Party and colloquially referred to as the Tory Party or the Tories , is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom that espouses the philosophies of conservatism and British unionism .

It governs in coalition with the Liberal Democrats , with party leader David Cameron as Prime Minister .
The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 , and was one of two dominant parties in the 19th century , along with the Liberal Party .
It changed its name to the Conservative and Unionist Party in 1912 after merging with the Liberal Unionist Party , although that name is rarely used and it is generally referred to as simply the Conservative Party .
In the 1920s , the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party became the Conservatives ' main rivals .
Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century , including Winston Churchill ( 1940–45 , 1951–55 ) and Margaret Thatcher ( 1979–90 ) .
Thatcher 's tenure led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation and saw the Conservatives become the most eurosceptic of the three major parties .
The party was returned to government in coalition , having failed to win a majority , in 2010 under the more `` liberal '' leadership of David Cameron .
In the European Parliament , the Conservatives are the largest British party with 25 MEPs , who sit with the soft eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists ( ECR ) parliamentary group , while the party itself is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists ( AECR ) Europarty .

what major agencies are studying earthquakes
Earthquake prediction `` is usually defined as the specification of the time , location , and magnitude of a future earthquake within stated limits '' , and particularly of `` the next strong earthquake to occur in a region . ''
This can be distinguished from earthquake forecasting , which is the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard , including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes , in a given area over periods of years or decades .
This can be further distinguished from real-time earthquake warning systems , which , upon detection of a severe earthquake , can provide neighboring regions a few seconds warning of potentially significant shaking .
To be useful , an earthquake prediction must be precise enough to warrant the cost of increased precautions , including disruption of ordinary activities and commerce , and timely enough that preparation can be made .
Predictions must also be reliable , as false alarms and cancelled alarms are not only economically costly , but seriously undermine confidence in , and thereby the effectiveness of , any kind of warning .
With over 7,000 earthquakes around the world each year with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater , trivial success in earthquake prediction is easily obtained using sufficiently broad parameters of time , location , or magnitude .
However , such trivial `` successful predictions '' are not useful .
Major earthquakes are often followed by reports that they were predicted , or at least anticipated , but no claim of a successful prediction of a major earthquake has survived close inquiry .
In the 1970s there was intense optimism amongst scientists that some method of predicting earthquakes might be found , but by the 1990s continuing failure led many scientists to question whether it was even possible .
While many scientists still hold that , given enough resources , prediction might be possible , many others maintain that earthquake prediction is inherently impossible .

who created the tourbillon movement ?
Stührling Tourbillon Movement ( ) .
In horology , a tourbillon ( ; `` whirlwind '' ) is an addition to the mechanics of a watch escapement .
Developed around 1795 by the French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet from an earlier idea by the English chronometer maker John Arnold , a tourbillon aims to counter the effects of gravity by mounting the escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage , to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece ( thus the escapement ) is stuck in a certain position .
Originally an attempt to improve accuracy , tourbillons are still included in some expensive modern watches as a novelty and demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity .
The mechanism is usually exposed on the watch 's face to show it off .
what is an .msi file
The Windows Installer ( previously known as Microsoft Installer ) is a software component used for the installation , maintenance , and removal of software on modern Microsoft Windows systems .
The installation information , and often the files themselves , are packaged in installation packages , loosely relational databases structured as COM Structured Storages and commonly known as `` MSI files '' , from their default file extension .
Windows Installer contains significant changes from its predecessor , Setup API .
New features include a GUI framework and automatic generation of the uninstallation sequence .
Windows Installer is positioned as an alternative to stand-alone executable installer frameworks such as older versions of InstallShield and NSIS .
Microsoft encourages third parties to use Windows Installer as the basis for installation frameworks , so that they synchronize correctly with other installers and keep the internal database of installed products consistent .
Important features such as rollback and versioning depend on a consistent internal database for reliable operation .
Furthermore , Windows Installer facilitates the principle of least privilege by performing software installations by proxy for unprivileged users .
what is a Four Lokos
Four Loko is a line of alcoholic beverages , originally marketed as energy drinks , sold by Phusion Projects of Chicago , Illinois .
Phusion operates as Drink Four Brewing Company .
Four Loko , the company 's most popular beverage , debuted in the United States market in 2005 .
It is now sold in 48 states , and in Canada , The Bahamas , Bolivia , Honduras , and Europe .
The name `` Four '' is derived from the original energy drink 's four main ingredients : alcohol , caffeine , taurine , and guarana .
Four branded products have been the object of legal , ethical , and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to the underaged and the purported danger of combining alcohol and caffeine .
After the beverage was banned in several states , a product reintroduction in December 2010 removed caffeine , taurine , and guarana as ingredients , and the malt beverage is no longer marketed as an energy drink .
what is a fret on a guitar
The neck of a guitar showing the nut ( in the background , coloured white ) and first four metal frets .
A fret is a raised element on the neck of a stringed instrument .
Frets usually extend across the full width of the neck .
On most modern western fretted instruments , frets are metal strips inserted into the fingerboard .
On some historical instruments and non-European instruments , frets are made of pieces of string tied around the neck .
Frets divide the neck into fixed segments at intervals related to a musical framework .
On instruments such as guitars , each fret represents one semitone in the standard western system where one octave is divided into twelve semitones .
Fret is often used as a verb , meaning simply `` to press down the string behind a fret . ''
Fretting often refers to the frets and/or their system of placement .
where did people go and drink during the prohibition
There was consumption of alcohol both during and after prohibition .
The 18th Amendment prohibited the production , distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States and was widely supported by the American public when it went into effect in 1920 .
The temperance movement had popularized the belief that alcohol was the major cause of most personal and social problems and prohibition was seen as the solution to the nation 's poverty , crime , violence , and other ills .
Upon ratification of the amendment , the famous evangelist Billy Sunday said that `` The slums will soon be only a memory .
We will turn our prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses and corncribs . ''
( Compare Christianity and alcohol . )
Since alcohol was to be banned and since it was seen as the cause of most , if not all , crime , some communities sold their jails .
The nation was highly optimistic and the leading prohibitionist in the United States Congress confidently asserted that `` There is as much chance of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a hummingbird to fly to the planet Mars with the Washington Monument tied to its tail.”
What is a millionth of a meter
The metre ( meter in American English ) , ( SI unit symbol : m ; SI dimension symbol : L ) , is the fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) .
Originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth 's equator to the North Pole ( at sea level ) , its definition has been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology .
Since 1983 , it has been defined as `` the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . ''
what are geologists currently researching
Geologists exploring Jurassic sedimentary rocks in Makhtesh Gadol , Negev Desert , Israel
Geologists explaining the importance of volcanic ash layers to students on field in Iceland
A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes and history that has shaped it .
Geologists usually engage in studying geology .
Geologists , studying more of an applied science than a theoretical one , must approach Geology using physics , chemistry and biology as well as other sciences .
Geologists , compared to scientists engaged in other fields , are generally more exposed to the outdoors than staying in laboratories ; although some geologists prefer to perform most of their studies in the lab .
Geologists are engaged in exploration for mining companies in search of metals , oils , and other Earth resources .
They are also in the forefront of natural hazards and disasters warning and mitigation , studying earthquakes , volcanic activity , tsunamis , weather storms , and the like ; their studies are used to warn the general public of the occurrence of these events .
Currently , geologists are also engaged in the discussion of climate change , as they study the history and evidence for this Earth process .

when did the us stop producing vacuum tubes
Modern vacuum tubes , mostly miniature style
In electronics , a vacuum tube , electron tube ( in North America ) , thermionic valve , tube , or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container .
The container is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shape .
The simplest vacuum tube , the diode , is essentially an incandescent light bulb with an added electrode inside .
When the bulb 's filament is heated white-hot , electrons are `` boiled '' off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulb .
If the electrode -- called a `` plate '' or `` anode '' -- is made more positive than the hot filament , a direct current flows through the vacuum to the electrode ( a demonstration of the Edison effect ) .
As the current only flows in one direction , it makes it possible to convert an alternating current applied to the filament to direct current .
The introduction of a third electrode , a grid between the filament and the plate , yields another function .
A voltage applied to the grid controls the current flowing from the filament to the plate .
Thus , it allows the device to be used as an electronic amplifier .
Vacuum tubes are thus used for rectification , amplification , switching , or similar processing or creation of electrical signals .
The vast majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a vacuum inside , and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament .
Some exceptions to this are dealt with in the section about gas-filled tubes below .
Vacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology , which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting , television , radar , sound reinforcement , sound recording and reproduction , large telephone networks , analog and digital computers , and industrial process control .
Although some applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter or mechanical computers , it was the invention of the vacuum tube with three electrodes ( called a triode ) and its capability of electronic amplification that made these technologies widespread and practical .
In most applications , solid-state devices such as transistors and other semiconductor devices have replaced tubes .
Solid-state devices last longer and are smaller , more efficient , more reliable , and cheaper than tubes .
Tubes can be fragile , sometimes generate significant unwanted heat , and can take many seconds—many minutes in critical applications—after powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational tolerance .
However , tubes still find uses where solid-state devices have not been developed , are impractical , or where a tube has superior performance , as with some devices in professional audio and high-power radio transmitters .
Tubes are still produced for such applications .
Tubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the electromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares .

where did winston churchill go to school
Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill , ( 30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965 ) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955 .
Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century , Churchill was also an officer in the British Army , a historian , a writer , and an artist .
He is the only British Prime Minister in history to have received the Nobel Prize in Literature , and was also the first person to be made an Honorary Citizen of the United States .
Churchill was born into an aristocratic family as the grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough .
His father , Lord Randolph Churchill , was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; his mother , Jennie Jerome , was an American socialite .
As a young army officer , he saw action in British India , The Sudan , and the Second Boer War .
He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns .
At the forefront of politics for fifty years , he held many political and cabinet positions .
Before the First World War , he served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of the Asquith Liberal government .
During the war , he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government .
He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers .
He returned to government as Minister of Munitions , Secretary of State for War , and Secretary of State for Air .
After the War , Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative ( Baldwin ) government of 1924–29 , controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy .
Also controversial was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII .
Out of office and politically `` in the wilderness '' during the 1930s , Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament .
On the outbreak of the Second World War , he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty .
Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 , Churchill became Prime Minister .
His steadfast refusal to consider defeat , surrender , or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance , especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone among European countries in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler .
Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts , which helped inspire the British people .
He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured .
After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election , he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour ( Attlee ) government .
After winning the 1951 election , he again became Prime Minister , before retiring in 1955 .
Upon his death , Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral , which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history .
Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll , Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history .

what organisms can not grow on a glucose salt medium
An agar plate -- an example of a bacterial growth medium .
Specifically , it is a streak plate ; the orange lines and dots are formed by bacterial colonies .
A growth medium or culture medium is a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of microorganisms or cells , or small plants like the moss Physcomitrella patens .
There are different types of media for growing different types of cells .
There are two major types of growth media : those used for cell culture , which use specific cell types derived from plants or animals , and microbiological culture , which are used for growing microorganisms , such as bacteria or yeast .
The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates ; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth .
Some organisms , termed fastidious organisms , require specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements .
Viruses , for example , are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth medium containing living cells .
what is an agents job role in film
A talent agent , or booking agent , is a person who finds jobs for actors , authors , film directors , musicians , models , producers , professional athletes , writers and other people in various entertainment businesses .
An agent also defends , supports and promotes the interest of his/her clients .
Agents can not produce their own shows due to conflict of interest .
A talent agent must be familiar with their clients .
An agent has to know what kind of work the client can and can not do in order to match them with various jobs .
Having an agent is not required , but does help the artist in getting jobs .
In many cases casting directors , or other businesses , go to talent agencies to find artists they are looking for .
The agent is paid a percentage of the star 's earnings ( typically 10 % ) .
Agents sometimes will be referred to as `` 10 percenters . ''
There are different regulations that govern different types of agents that are established by artist 's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates .
There are also professional organizations that license talent agencies .
Since the decline in viewership in theaters , from the 1950s to 1960s , this caused a monumental shift in how studios would produce films and thus reducing the cost of exclusive and expensive actors .
Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios .
Because of this , agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option .
Agents now became third parties that negotiated between studios and clients , this making their services imperative between each party .
Since talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts , all talent agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code , which calls an agent a `` person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring , offering , promising , or attempting to procure employment for artist or artists . ''
who discovered the 2 moons of mars , Phobos and Deimos
Mars has two known moons , Phobos and Deimos , which are thought to be captured asteroids .
Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall and are named after the characters Phobos ( panic/fear ) and Deimos ( terror/dread ) who , in Greek mythology , accompanied their father Ares , god of war , into battle .
Ares was known as Mars to the Romans .
It is possible that Mars may have moons smaller than 50 - 100 meters and a dust ring between Phobos and Deimos may be present but none have been discovered .
WHAT IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT MURDER BOOK
In law enforcement parlance , the term murder book refers to the case file of a murder investigation .
Typically , murder books include crime scene photographs and sketches , autopsy and forensic reports , transcripts of investigators ' notes and witness interviews .
The murder book encapsulates the complete paper trail of a murder investigation , from the time the murder is first reported through the arrest of a suspect .
Law enforcement agencies typically guard murder books carefully , and it is unusual for civilians to be given unfettered access to these kinds of records , especially for unsolved cases .

what are Knowledge Skills Abilities
A KSA , or Knowledge , Skills , and Abilities , is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to United States Federal government job openings .
KSAs are used to determine , along with resumes , who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job .
The knowledge , skills and abilities ( KSAs ) necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement .
In 2009 the Office of Personal Management asked federal agencies to stop requiring job applicants to fill out the questionnaires , to be phased out within a year .
KSAs are brief and focused essays about one 's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for .
A knowledge , skills , and abilities ( KSA ) is a concise essay about one 's talent and expertise and related experiences ( work , education , volunteer ) and accomplishments .
A series of KSA statements are usually required when applying for most federal government and some state and city government jobs .
KSAs are used as a yardstick to assess the capabilities of a prospective applicant in terms of likely ability to perform the duties of the job .
Most government hiring officials look for a short , crisp and clear KSA that emphasizes results or accomplishments obtained in previous work .
KSA statements are also known as Evaluation Factors .
Other agencies sometimes call them `` Rating Factors '' , `` Quality Ranking Factors '' , `` Knowledge , Abilities , skills and Other Characteristics '' , or `` Job Elements '' .
The name can be just a name but often it influences content and length of the essay .
Every agency has its own regulations but most of the time the each KSA factor should be 1/2 to 11⁄2 pages long .
The below definitions are defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management :
Knowledge , Skills , and Abilities ( KSAs ) - The attributes required to perform a job and are generally demonstrated through qualifying service , education , or training .
Knowledge - Is a body of information applied directly to the performance of a function .
Skill - Is an observable competence to perform a learned psychomotor act .
Ability - Is competence to perform an observable behavior or a behavior that results in an observable product .
The scoring of KSA essays is based on a scale of from one to 100 .
Job applicants must score above 70 to be considered for the position .
High scores are derived through answering the KSA question as specifically as possible , providing examples from previous employment or training that clearly demonstrate you meet the qualifications .
When applying to federal government positions , a Federal Resume is usually required in addition to KSA statements .

what is 5 1 arm mortgage
A variable-rate mortgage , adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) , or tracker mortgage is a mortgage loan with the interest rate on the note periodically adjusted based on an index which reflects the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets .
The loan may be offered at the lender 's standard variable rate/ base rate .
There may be a direct and legally-defined link to the underlying index , but where the lender offers no specific link to the underlying market or index the rate can be changed at the lender 's discretion .
The term `` variable-rate mortgage '' is most common outside the United States , whilst in the United States , `` adjustable-rate mortgage '' is most common , and implies a mortgage regulated by the Federal government , with caps on charges .
In many countries , adjustable rate mortgages are the norm , and in such places , may simply be referred to as mortgages .
Among the most common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury ( CMT ) securities , the Cost of Funds Index ( COFI ) , and the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) .
A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index , rather than using other indices .
This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender , whose own cost of funding will usually be related to the index .
Consequently , payments made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate ( alternatively , the term of the loan may change ) .
This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage , which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate .
Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest only mortgage , the fixed rate mortgage , the negative amortization mortgage , and the balloon payment mortgage .
Adjustable rates transfer part of the interest rate risk from the lender to the borrower .
They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain .
The borrower benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases .
The borrower benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages .
who killed robert kennedy
The assassination of Robert Francis `` Bobby '' Kennedy , a United States Senator and brother of assassinated President John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy , took place shortly after midnight on June 5 , 1968 , in Los Angeles , California , during the campaign season for the United States Presidential election , 1968 .
After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States , Kennedy was shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty-six hours later .
Sirhan Sirhan , a 24-year-old Palestinian / Jordanian immigrant , was convicted of Kennedy 's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime .
Sirhan 's lawyers have released statements claiming evidence that he was framed .
The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter , and the aftermath was captured on film .
Kennedy 's body lay in repose at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral mass was held on June 8 .
His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery .
His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service .
Hubert Humphrey went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency , but ultimately narrowly lost the election to Richard Nixon .
As with his brother Jack 's death , Bobby 's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories .
As of 2013 Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated ( the other being Huey Long ) .
what time was the modern age from\
The Modern Age of Comic Books is an informal name for the period in the history of mainstream American comic books generally considered to last from the mid-1980s until present day .
In this period , comic book characters generally became darker and more psychologically complex , creators became better-known and active in changing the industry , independent comics flourished , and larger publishing houses became more commercialized .
An alternate name for this period is the Dark Age of Comic Books , due to the popularity and artistic influence of grim titles , such as and Watchmen .
when Harry met Sally case
When Harry Met Sally ... is a 1989 American romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner .
It stars Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally .
The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive , through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City .
The film raises the question `` Can men and women ever just be friends ? '' and advances many ideas about relationships that became household concepts , such as those of the `` '' girlfriend and the `` transitional person '' .
The origins of the film came from Reiner 's return to single life after a divorce .
An interview Ephron conducted with Reiner provided the basis for Harry .
Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends .
Crystal came on board and made his own contributions to the screenplay , making Harry funnier .
Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal .
The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick , Jr. , with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman .
Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance .
Columbia Pictures released the film using the `` platform '' technique , which involved opening it in a few select cities , letting positive word of mouth generate interest , and then gradually expanding distribution over subsequent weeks .
When Harry Met Sally ... grossed a total of US $ 92 .8 million in North America .
Ephron received a British Academy Film Award , an Oscar nomination , and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for her screenplay .
The film is ranked 23rd on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo 's `` 100 Funniest Movies '' .
In early 2004 , the film was adapted for the stage in a production starring Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan .

A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a satellite .
More explicitly , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation , but that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of other objects .
The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun , brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-Neptunian objects that rivaled Pluto in size , and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object , Eris .
This classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighbourhood of their orbit are defined as planets , while those that are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as small Solar System bodies .
Dwarf planets come in between .
The exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the IAU has been both praised and criticized ; it was said to be the `` right decision '' by Mike Brown , who discovered and other new dwarf planets , but has been rejected by Alan Stern , who had coined the term dwarf planet in 1990 .
The IAU currently recognizes five dwarf planets in the Solar System : , Pluto , , , and .
However , only two of these bodies , Ceres and Pluto , have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they fit the definition .
Eris has been accepted as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto .
The IAU subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 ( and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1 ) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets .
The only two such objects known at the time , Makemake and Haumea , went through this naming procedure and were declared to be dwarf planets .
It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets .
Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored , and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered .
Individual astronomers recognize several of these , and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects , ranging from `` nearly certain '' to `` possible '' dwarf planets . '
Brown identifies nine known objects – the five accepted by the IAU plus , , , and – as `` virtually certain '' , with another two dozen highly likely , and there are probably a hundred or so such objects in total .
The classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed .
what are debit cards made of
A debit card ( also known as a bank card or check card ) is a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic access to his or her bank account ( s ) at a financial institution .
Some cards have a stored value with which a payment is made , while most relay a message to the cardholder 's bank to withdraw funds from a payee 's designated bank account .
The card , where accepted , can be used instead of cash when making purchases .
In some cases , the primary account number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card .
In many countries , the use of debit cards has become so widespread that their volume has overtaken or entirely replaced cheques and , in some instances , cash transactions .
The development of debit cards , unlike credit cards and charge cards , has generally been country specific resulting in a number of different systems around the world , which were often incompatible .
Since the mid-2000s , a number of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be used in other countries and allowed their use for internet and phone purchases .
Unlike credit and charge cards , payments using a debit card are immediately transferred from the cardholder 's designated bank account , instead of them paying the money back at a later date .
Debit cards usually also allow for instant withdrawal of cash , acting as the ATM card for withdrawing cash .
Merchants may also offer cashback facilities to customers , where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase .
when did jack lalanne die
Francois Henri `` Jack '' LaLanne ( September 26 , 1914 - January 23 , 2011 ) was an American fitness , exercise , and nutritional expert and motivational speaker who is sometimes called `` the godfather of fitness '' and the `` first fitness superhero . ''
He described himself as being a `` sugarholic '' and a `` junk food junkie '' until he was 15 .
He also had behavioral problems , but `` turned his life around '' after listening to a public lecture by Paul Bragg , a well-known nutrition speaker .
During his career , he came to believe that the country 's overall health depended on the health of its population , writing that `` physical culture and nutrition — is the salvation of America . ''
Decades before health and fitness began being promoted by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons , LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet .
He published numerous books on fitness and hosted a fitness television show between 1953 and 1985 .
As early as 1936 , at age 21 , he opened one of the nation 's first fitness gyms in Oakland , California , which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms using his name .
One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women , whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs .
He invented a number of exercise machines , including leg-extension and pulley devices .
Besides producing his own series of videos , he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise , believing it would enable them to enhance their strength .
LaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder , as well as for his prodigious feats of strength .
Arnold Schwarzenegger once stated , `` That Jack LaLanne 's an animal ! , '' after LaLanne , at 54 , beat a 21-year-old Schwarzenegger `` badly '' in an informal contest .
On the occasion of LaLanne 's death , Schwarzenegger credited LaLanne for being `` an apostle for fitness '' by inspiring `` billions all over the world to live healthier lives , '' and , as governor of California , had earlier placed him on his Governor 's Council on Physical Fitness .
Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim waist .
He was inducted to the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
what rank is the highest in the air force
Air forces of most of the countries use system similar to Armies .
However , the RAF and the air forces of many Commonwealth countries , or those formerly under a British influence , use a different set of ranks loosely based on naval equivalents ; Lieutenant , Commander , Captain and Commodore are prefixed for air force use with Flight , Wing , Group and Air , respectively ( the first three being the units that they used to command ) .

who made the original care bears
The Care Bears are characters created by American Greetings in 1981 for use on greeting cards .
The original artwork for the cards was painted by artist Elena Kucharik .
In 1983 , Kenner turned the Care Bears into plush teddy bears .
The Care Bears appeared in their own TV specials called The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings ( 1983 ) and The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine ( 1984 ) .
They also had their own television series from 1985 to 1988 , in addition to three feature films : The Care Bears Movie ( 1985 ) , Care Bears Movie II : A New Generation ( 1986 ) , and The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland ( 1987 ) .
Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its duty and personality .
This insignia was known as their `` tummy symbol . ''
However , the movie Care Bears : Oopsy Does It ! renamed them `` belly badges '' .
Adding to the Care Bear family are the `` Care Bear Cousins '' , which feature a lion , rabbit , penguin , raccoon , and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears .
In 2002 , the bears were reintroduced with new toys .
Made by Play-Along Toys , the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch , aerobic bears , and glow-in-the-dark bears .

It was the first Interstate Highway project in the United States .
I-70 approximately traces the path of U.S. Route 40 ( and also the old National Road ) east of the Rocky Mountains .
West of the Rockies , the route of I-70 was derived from multiple sources .
I-70 is the fifth longest Interstate Highway , after I-90 , I-80 , I-40 , and I-10 .
The construction of I-70 in Colorado and Utah is considered an engineering marvel as the route passes through the Eisenhower Tunnel , Glenwood Canyon , and the San Rafael Swell .
The Eisenhower Tunnel is the highest point along the Interstate Highway system with an elevation of .
The sections of the interstate in Missouri and Kansas have laid claim to be the first interstate in the United States .
Though disputed , the Federal Highway Administration has claimed the section of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon , completed in 1992 , was the last piece of the Interstate Highway system , as originally planned , to open to traffic .
when do solar eclipses happen ?
Photo of 1999 total eclipse
As seen from the Earth , a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth , and the Moon fully or partially blocks ( `` occults `` ) the Sun .
This can happen only at new moon , when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy .
In a total eclipse , the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon .
In partial and annular eclipses only part of the Sun is obscured .
If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit , a little closer to the Earth , and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every single month .
However , the Moon 's orbit is inclined ( tilted ) at more than 5 degrees to Earth 's orbit around the Sun ( see ecliptic ) so its shadow at new moon usually misses Earth .
Earth 's orbit is called the ecliptic plane as the Moon 's orbit must cross this plane in order for an eclipse ( both solar as well as lunar ) to occur .
In addition , the Moon 's actual orbit is elliptical , often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun totally .
The orbital planes cross each year at a line of nodes resulting in at least two , and up to five , solar eclipses occurring each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses .
However , total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on Earth 's surface traced by the Moon 's shadow or umbra .
An eclipse is a natural phenomenon .
Nevertheless , in some ancient and modern cultures , solar eclipses have been attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens .
A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation , as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes .
Because it is dangerous to look directly at the Sun , observers should use special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques when viewing a partial eclipse , or the partial phases of a total eclipse .
It is safe to view the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection , however .
People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses .
what are the three dominant political parties in America ?
A political party ( from , Genitive partis , `` part '' , `` portion '' ) is a political organization that typically seeks to influence , or entirely control , government policy , usually by nominating candidates with aligned political views and trying to seat them in political office .
Parties participate in electoral campaigns and educational outreach or protest actions .
Parties often espouse an ideology or vision , expressed in a party program , bolstered by a written platform with specific goals , forming a coalition among disparate interests .
where do mangos come from
The mango is a fleshy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera , consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae .
The mango is native to South Asia , from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics .
While other Mangifera species ( e.g . horse mango , M. foetida ) are also grown on a more localized basis , Mangifera indica – the 'common mango ' or 'Indian mango ' – is the only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions .
It is the national fruit of India , Pakistan and Philippines .
In several cultures , its fruit and leaves are ritually used as floral decorations at weddings , public celebrations and religious ceremonies .

what latitude is tropic of cancer
World map showing the Tropic of Cancer
The Tropic of Cancer , also referred to as the Northern tropic , is the circle of latitude on the Earth that marks the most northerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead at its zenith .
This event occurs once per year , at the time of the June solstice , when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent .
It currently ( Year 2013 ) lies at 23° 26′ 15.143′′ north of the Equator .
Its Southern Hemisphere counterpart , marking the most southerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead , is the Tropic of Capricorn .
These tropics are two of the five major degree measures or major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth , besides the Arctic and Antarctic Circles and the Equator .
The positions of these circles of latitude ( other than the Equator ) are dictated by the tilt of the Earth 's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit .
what video format will play in a DVD player
DVD-Video is a consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD discs , and is currently the dominant consumer video format in Asia , North America , Europe , and Australia .
Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a DVD drive and an H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 decoder ( e.g. , a DVD player , or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player ) .
Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination of H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 compressed video and audio of varying formats ( often multi-channel formats as described below ) .
Typically , the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3 Mbit/s to 9.5 Mbit/s , and the bit rate is usually adaptive .
It was first available for retail around 1997 .
The DVD-Video specification was created by DVD Forum and can be obtained from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $ 5,000 .
The specification is not publicly available , because every subscriber must sign a non-disclosure agreement .
Certain information in the DVD Book is proprietary and confidential .
what is a leecher torrent ?
In computing and specifically Internet , a leech is one who benefits , usually deliberately , from others ' information or effort but does not offer anything in return , or makes only token offerings in an attempt to avoid being called a leech .
In economics , this type of behavior is called `` free riding '' and is associated with the free rider problem .
Depending on context , leeching does not necessarily refer to illegal use of computer resources , but often instead to greedy use according to etiquette : to wit , using too much of what is freely given without contributing a reasonable amount back to the community that provides it .
The name derives from the leech , an animal that sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed .
Other terms are used , such as `` freeloader '' , but leech is the most common .
what part of the government governs the US post office ?
The full eagle logo , used in various versions from 1970 to 1993 .
The United States Postal Service ( USPS ) , also known as the Post Office and U.S. Mail , is an independent agency of the United States federal government responsible for providing postal service in the United States .
It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution .
The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress , where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general .
The cabinet-level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin 's operation and transformed into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act .
The USPS employs over 574,000 workers and operates over 260,000 vehicles .
The USPS is the operator of the largest vehicle fleet in the world .
The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans , regardless of geography , at uniform price and quality .
The USPS has exclusive access to letter boxes marked `` U.S. Mail '' and personal letterboxes in the United States , but still competes against private package delivery services , such as UPS and FedEx .
The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters .
Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume , after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act `` , ( which mandated $ 5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care , 75 years into the future , a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S. ) , revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume , prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit .
what state is the capital in
Washington , D.C. has been the capital of the United States since 1800 .
Eight other cities have served as the meeting place for Congress and are therefore considered to have once been the capital of the United States .
In addition , each of the 50 U.S. states and the five principal territories of the United States maintains its own capital .
what are square diamonds called ?
Princess cut diamond set in a ring
The Princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds , next to a round brilliant .
The face-up shape of the princess cut is square or rectangular and the profile or side-on shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sides .
The princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut , having been created in the 1960s .
It has gained in popularity in recent years as a more distinctive alternative to the more popular round brilliant cut , in which the top of diamond , called the crown , is cut with a round face-up shape and the bottom , called the pavilion , is shaped similar to a cone .
A princess cut with the same width as the diameter of a round brilliant will weigh more as it has four corners which would otherwise have been cut off and rounded to form a round brilliant .
The princess cut is sometimes referred to as a square modified brilliant .
However , while displaying the same high degree of brilliance , its faceting style is unique and completely different from that of a round brilliant .
The Princess cut had its origins in the early `` French '' cut , having a step-modified `` Double-French '' or `` Cross '' cut crown and a series of unique , chevron-shaped facets in the pavilion which combine to give a distinct cross-shaped reflection when the stone is viewed directly through the table .
Effectively , the Princess cut combines the high degree of light return of a round brilliant cut with a distinctive square or rectangular shape .
The square princess cut diamond is usually slightly cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds of the same carat weight because it retains about 80 % of the rough diamond , as opposed to the round brilliant which retains only about 50 % of the rough .
The ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters .
Accredited Gem Appraisers ( AGA ) and American Gem Society Laboratory ( AGSL ) and European Gem Laboratories-USA ( EGL-USA ) are currently the only labs that grade the Princess cut for cut .
There is no universal definition of what measurements make an ideal princess cut diamond and many diamond manufacturers market ideal diamonds with differing facet patterns and angles as `` ideal cut '' .
In contrast to the AGSL , AGA , and EGL-USA the Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) has stated that there is not enough industry consensus or empirical data to specify cut grading standards for Princess cut diamonds and to do so is at the risk of consumers who may be deceived by diamonds accompanied by unqualified Ideal or Excellent cut grades .
The name `` Princess Cut '' was originally used in connection with another diamond cut , otherwise known as the `` Profile '' cut , designed by Arpad Nagy , a London cutter , in 1961 .
The same name was later used and made popular by Ygal Perlman , Betzalel Ambar , and Israel Itzkowitz in Israel in 1979 .
A similar cut with only 49 facets , as opposed to the original 58 facets of the princess cut , was later branded the `` Quadrillion '' and initially distributed by Ambar Diamonds in Los Angeles .
Three years of optical research yielded a square stone with faceting similar to that of a round brilliant cut diamond .
A Comparison
The number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamond .
This can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports .
By adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond , the individual facets of the diamond will now be broken down into smaller facets .
As a result , it can give a princess cut diamond a `` crushed ice '' look .
Vice versa , when a princess cut diamond has lesser chevrons , it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets .
what is a dogs classification
The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris ) is a subspecies of the gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) , a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora .
The term `` domestic dog '' is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties .
The dog has been the first animal to be domesticated and has been the most widely kept working , hunting , and pet animal in human history .
The word `` dog '' may also mean the male of a canine species , as opposed to the word `` bitch '' for the female of the species .
MtDNA evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog 's lineage and the modern wolf 's lineage around 100,000 years ago but , , the oldest fossil specimens genetically linked to the modern dog 's lineage date to approximately 33,000-36,000 years ago .
Dogs ' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures .
Dogs perform many roles for people , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship , and , more recently , aiding handicapped individuals .
This impact on human society has given them the nickname `` Man 's Best Friend '' in the Western world .
In some cultures , dogs are also a source of meat .
In 2001 , there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world .
Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old , having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles .
Through this selective breeding , the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds , and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal .
For example , height measured to the withers ranges from in the Chihuahua to about in the Irish Wolfhound ; color varies from white through grays ( usually called `` blue '' ) to black , and browns from light ( tan ) to dark ( `` red '' or `` chocolate '' ) in a wide variation of patterns ; coats can be short or long , coarse-haired to wool-like , straight , curly , or smooth .
It is common for most breeds to shed this coat .
what types of microscopes do not require a vacuum
Diagram of a transmission electron microscope
A 1973 Siemens electron microscope , Musée des Arts et Métiers , Paris
An electron microscope ( EM ) is a type of microscope that uses an electron beam to illuminate a specimen and produce a magnified image .
An EM has greater resolving power than a light microscope and can reveal the structure of smaller objects because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than visible light photons .
They can achieve better than 50 pm resolution and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas ordinary , non-confocal light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x .
The electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control the electron beam and focus it to form an image .
These electron optical lenses are analogous to the glass lenses of a light optical microscope .
Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples , metals , and crystals .
Industrially , the electron microscope is often used for quality control and failure analysis .
Modern electron microscopes produce electron micrographs , using specialized digital cameras or frame grabbers to capture the image .

what president was theodore roosevelt
Theodore `` T.R . ''
Roosevelt , Jr. ( ; October 27 , 1858—January 6 , 1919 ) was the 26th President of the United States ( 1901–1909 ) .
He is noted for his exuberant personality , range of interests and achievements , and his leadership of the Progressive Movement , as well as his `` cowboy `` persona and robust masculinity .
He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the first incarnation of the short-lived Progressive ( `` Bull Moose '' ) Party of 1912 .
Before becoming President , he held offices at the city , state , and federal levels .
Roosevelt 's achievements as a naturalist , explorer , hunter , author , and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician .
Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the United States in 1901 , making him the youngest president ever ; he beat out the youngest elected president , John F. Kennedy , by only one year .
Roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the Nobel Peace Prize .
The Teddy bear is named after him , despite his contempt for being called `` Teddy '' .
Born into a wealthy family in New York City , Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history .
To overcome his physical weakness , he embraced a strenuous life .
Home-schooled , he became an eager student of nature .
He attended Harvard University , where he studied biology , boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs .
In 1881 , one year out of Harvard , he was elected to the New York State Assembly , where he became a leader of the reform faction of his Republican Party ( the `` GOP '' ) .
His The Naval War of 1812 ( 1882 ) established his professional reputation as a serious historian ; he wrote numerous books on hunting , the outdoors , and current political issues , as well as frontier history .
In 1884 , his first wife and his mother died on the same day .
He temporarily left politics and went to the frontier , becoming a rancher in the `` Badlands '' in the Dakotas .
Returning to New York City , he ran for mayor in 1886 , finishing third with 60,000 votes .
He later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police .
At the national level , he was a leader in civil service reform .
The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898 while Roosevelt was , effectively , running the Department of the Navy .
He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba .
The war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president .
He successfully energized the GOP base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect President William McKinley on a platform of high tariffs , the gold standard , imperialism , prosperity at home and victory abroad .
In 1901 , President William McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President .
He attempted to move the Republican Party ( GOP ) toward Progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses .
Roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the Presidency ( from the Vice-Presidency ) upon the death of his predecessor , winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested election of 1820 .
Roosevelt coined the phrase `` Square Deal `` to describe his domestic agenda , emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies .
As an outdoorsman and naturalist , he promoted the conservation movement .
On the world stage , Roosevelt 's policies were characterized by his slogan , `` Speak softly and carry a big stick `` .
what is 2nd or 3rd cousin once removed
A cousin is a relative with whom a person shares one or more common ancestor ( s ) ( other than a parent , child/descendant , sibling , child/descendant of a sibling , or sibling of a parent/ancestor ) .
However in common parlance , `` cousin '' normally specifically means `` first cousin '' .
Systems of `` degrees '' and `` removals '' are used in the English-speaking world to describe the exact relationship between two cousins ( in the broad sense ) and the ancestor they have in common .
Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can more precisely specify kinships with common ancestors existing any number of generations in the past , though common usage often eliminates the degrees and removals and refers to people with common ancestry as simply `` distant cousins '' or `` relatives '' .

Like NBC 's earlier hit Diff'rent Strokes , Webster featured a young African-American boy adopted by a white family .
when a cell divides
Three types of cell division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells .
Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle .
In eukaryotes , there are two distinct type of cell division : a vegetative division , whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ) , and a reductive cell division , whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half , to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ) .
Both of these cell division cycles are required in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle , and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells .
All cell divisions , regardless of organism , are preceded by a single round of DNA replication .
For simple unicellular organisms such as the amoeba , one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created .
On a larger scale , mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms , such as plants that grow from cuttings .
Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote , which itself was produced by cell division from gametes .
And after growth , cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism .
A human being 's body experiences about 10,000 trillion cell divisions in a lifetime .
Cell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules .
The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell 's genome .
Before division can occur , the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated , and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells .
A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between `` generations '' .

who sings backup on no one to blame howard jones
Howard Jones ( born John Howard Jones , 23 February 1955 , Southampton , Hampshire , England ) is a British musician , singer and songwriter .
According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums , `` Jones is an accomplished singer-songwriter who was a regular chart visitor in the mid-1980s with his brand of synthpop .
Jones , who was equally popular in the U.S. , appeared at Live Aid `` .
Allmusic journalist , Stephen Thomas Erlewine adds , `` Jones was one of the defining figures of mid-1980s synthpop .
His music merged the technology intensive sound of New Wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late 1960s pop .
Jones racked up a string of hits in the mid and late 1980s , before he retreated into being a cult figure in the 1990s '' .
what year did phil mellor die at iom tt wiki
The International Isle of Man TT ( Tourist Trophy ) Race is a motorcycle racing event held on the Isle of Man and was for many years the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world .
The event was part of the FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World Championship during the period 1949–1976 before being transferred to the United Kingdom after safety concerns and run by the FIM as the British Grand Prix for the 1977 season .
The Isle of Man TT Races became part of the TT Formula 1 Championship from 1977 to 1990 to preserve the event 's racing status .
From 1989 the racing has been developed by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival .
The race is run in a time-trial format on public roads closed for racing by the provisions of an Act of Tynwald ( the parliament of the Isle of Man ) .
The first race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy .
The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the St John 's Short Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal touring motorcycles with exhaust silencers , saddles , pedals and mud-guards .
The winner of the single-cylinder class , and overall winner of the first event in 1907 , was Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle in a time of 4 hours , 8 minutes and 8 seconds at an average race speed of 38.21 mph .
The winner of the twin-cylinder class was Rem Fowler riding a Peugeot engined Norton in a time of 4 hours 21 minutes and 52 seconds at an average race speed of 36.21 mph .
The trophy presented to Charlie Collier as the winner of the 1907 Isle of Man TT Race , was donated by the Marquis de Mouzilly St. Mars .
It featured a stylised version of Olympic God Hermes by Giovanni Da Bologna as a silver figurine astride a winged wheel .
The trophy was similar in design to the 18 carat gold Montague Trophy presented to John Napier ( Arrol-Johnston ) as the inaugural winner of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy car race in 1905 now known as the RAC Tourist Trophy .
The Marquis de Mouzilly St. Mars Trophy is now presented annually to the winner of the Isle of Man Senior TT Motor-Cycle Race .
The 2007 Isle of Man TT was the Centenary event which ran between 26 May and 8 June 2007 and featured a special Re-enactment of the 1907 Isle of Man TT Race held on the village green next to Tynwald Hill in St John 's on Monday 28 May 2007 .
The vintage parade of 100 classic motorcycles for the Centenary Re-enactment on the original St John 's Short Course was flagged away by former World Motor-Cycle Champion Geoff Duke .
The first of the participants to be flagged away was the recently restored twin-cylinder Peugeot-Norton ridden by Rem Fowler during the first Isle of Man TT Race in 1907 .
Also participating in the 2007 Re-enactment was TT race competitor Guy Martin riding a 1938 Triumph Tiger 100 500 cc and other former TT competitors including Alan Cathcart , Sammy Miller , Nick Jefferies and Mick Grant also completed the Re-enactment lap .
when did mass unemployment start ?
upright=1.15
Unemployment ( or joblessness ) occurs when people are without work and actively seeking work .
The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force .
During periods of recession , an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate .
According to International Labour Organization report , more than 197 million people globally are out of work or 6 % of the world 's workforce were without a job in 2012 .
There remains considerable theoretical debate regarding the causes , consequences and solutions for unemployment .
Classical economics , New classical economics , and the Austrian School of economics argue that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment .
These theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside , such as unionization , minimum wage laws , taxes , and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers .
Keynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions .
This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers .
Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers ; these can include financial stimuli , publicly funded job creation , and expansionist monetary policies .
In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment , there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system .
The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets , including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets .
Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization .
Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals ' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job .
Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates .
Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making , and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages .
what society is collectivist
Collectivism is any philosophic , political , religious , economic , or social outlook that emphasizes the interdependence of every human being in a society or civilization .
Collectivism is a basic cultural element that exists as the reverse of individualism in human nature ( in the same way high context culture exists as the reverse of low context culture ) .
Collectivist orientations stress the importance of cohesion within social groups ( such as an `` in-group '' , in what specific context it is defined ) and in some cases , the priority of group goals over individual goals .
Collectivists often focus on community , society , nation or country .
It has been used as an element in many different and diverse types of government and political , economic and educational philosophies throughout history and most human societies in practice contain elements of both individualism and collectivism .
Some examples of collectivist cultures include India and Japan .
Collectivism can be divided into horizontal collectivism and vertical collectivism .
Horizontal collectivism stresses collective decision-making among equal individuals , and is thus usually based on decentralization and egalitarianism .
Vertical collectivism is based on hierarchical structures of power and on moral and cultural conformity , and is therefore based on centralization and hierarchy .
A cooperative enterprise would be an example of horizontal collectivism , whereas a military hierarchy would be an example of vertical collectivism .
what is adem disease
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) is an immune mediated disease of the brain .
It usually occurs following a viral infection but may appear following vaccination , bacterial or parasitic infection , or even appear spontaneously .
As it involves autoimmune demyelination , it is similar to multiple sclerosis , and is considered part of the Multiple sclerosis borderline diseases .
The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year .
Although it occurs in all ages , most reported cases are in children and adolescents , with the average age around 5 to 8 years old .
The mortality rate may be as high as 5 % , full recovery is seen in 50 to 75 % of cases , while up to 70 to 90 % recover with some minor residual disability .
The average time to recover is one to six months .
ADEM produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord , particularly in the white matter .
Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres , cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord , but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex , thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved .
When the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode , it is called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis ( MDEM ) .
where does acid from stomach originate ?
The stomach is a muscular , hollow , dilated part of the digestion system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in some animals , including vertebrates , echinoderms , insects ( mid-gut ) , and molluscs .
It is involved in the second phase of digestion , following mastication ( chewing ) .
The stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine .
It secretes protein-digesting enzymes called protease and strong acids to aid in food digestion , ( sent to it via esophageal peristalsis ) through smooth muscular contortions ( called segmentation ) before sending partially digested food ( chyme ) to the small intestines .
The word stomach is derived from the Latin stomachus which is derived from the Greek word stomachos ( στόμαχος ) , ultimately from stoma ( ) , `` mouth '' .
The words gastro- and gastric ( meaning related to the stomach ) are both derived from the Greek word gaster ( ) .
what kind of wood was used for car trim ?
1940 Pontiac Special Series 25 Woodie
A woodie is a car body style , especially a station wagon , where the rear bodywork is constructed of wood framework with infill panels of wood or painted metal .
After the demise of actual wood construction , manufacturers used simulated woodgrain sheet vinyl—sometimes augmented with three-dimensional , simulated framework—to recall wood construction .
In 2008 , wood construction was evoked abstractly on the Ford Flex with a series of side and rear horizontal grooves .
what is a biwa pearl
A pearl is a hard object produced within the soft tissue ( specifically the mantle ) of a living shelled mollusc .
Just like the shell of a clam , a pearl is made up of calcium carbonate in minute crystalline form , which has been deposited in concentric layers .
The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth , but many other shapes of pearls ( baroque pearls ) occur .
The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries , and because of this , the word pearl has become a metaphor for something very rare , fine , admirable , and valuable .
The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild , but they are extremely rare .
These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls .
Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those that are currently sold .
Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry , but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor , and often , artificial pearls are easily distinguished from genuine pearls .
Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry , but in the past they were also stitched onto lavish clothing .
Pearls have also been crushed and used in cosmetics , medicines , and in paint formulations .
Whether wild or cultured , gem quality pearls are almost always nacreous and , as is the interior of the shell that produces them .
However , almost all species of shelled molluscs are capable of producing pearls ( formally referred to as `` calcareous concretions '' by some sources ) of lesser shine or less spherical shape .
Although these may also be legitimately referred to as `` pearls '' by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules , and are formed in the same way , most of them have no value , except as curiosities .
who created bing
Bing ( known previously as Live Search , Windows Live Search , and MSN Search ) is a web search engine ( advertised as a `` decision engine `` ) from Microsoft .
Bing was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28 , 2009 at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego for release on June 1 .
Notable changes include the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches ( called `` Explore pane '' ) based on semantic technology from Powerset which Microsoft purchased in 2008 .
On July 29 , 2009 , Microsoft and Yahoo ! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo ! Search .
All Yahoo ! Search global customers and partners are expected to have made the transition by early 2012 .
In October 2011 , Bing announced it was working on new back-end search infrastructure , with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users .
Known as `` Tiger '' , the new index-serving technology has been incorporated into Bing globally , since August 2011 .
In May 2012 , Bing announced another redesign of its search engine that includes `` Sidebar '' , a social feature that searches users ' social networks for information relevant to the search query .
who usually catches the football
A diagram showing an I Formation on offense and a 4-3 Formation on defense
In American football , each team has eleven players on the field at one time .
The specific role that a player takes on the field is called their position .
Under the modern rules of American football , teams are allowed unlimited subsititutions , that is teams may change any number of players after any play .
This has resulted in the development of three `` platoons '' of players , the offense ( the team with the ball , who is trying to score ) , the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring , and to take the ball from them ) , and the special teams ( who play in kicking situations ) .
Within those platoons , various specific positions exist depending on what the player 's main job is .
what percentage of irish people get an education
The Irish people ( or na hÉireannaigh ; Ulster-Scots : Airish fowk ) are an ethnic group who originate in Ireland , an island in northwestern Europe .
Ireland has been populated for around 9,000 years ( according to archaeological studies , see Prehistoric Ireland ) .
The Irish people 's earliest ancestors are recorded in legends – they are claimed to be descended from groups such as the Nemedians , Fomorians , Fir Bolg , Tuatha Dé Danann and the Milesians .
Lebor Gabála Érenn , a book of Irish mythology tells that Milesians were Scythian descendants .
The main groups that interacted with the Irish in the Middle Ages include the Picts , Scots , and the Vikings .
Due to this contact , Icelanders are noted for having some Irish descent .
The Anglo-Norman invasion of the High Middle Ages , the English plantations and the subsequent English rule of the country introduced the Normans and Flemish into Ireland .
Welsh , Picts , Bretons , and small parties of Gauls and even Anglo-Saxons are known in Ireland from much earlier times .
There have been many notable Irish people throughout history .
The 6th century Irish monk and missionary Columbanus is regarded as one of the `` fathers of Europe '' , followed by Kilian of Würzburg and Vergilius of Salzburg .
The scientist Robert Boyle is considered the `` father of chemistry `` .
Famous Irish explorers include Brendan the Navigator , Robert McClure , Ernest Shackleton and Tom Crean .
By some accounts , the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides ; and an Irishman was the first European to set foot on American soil in Columbus ' expedition of 1492 .
There are descendants of Irish people living in many western countries , particularly in English-speaking countries .
Historically , emigration has been caused by politics , famine and economic issues .
An estimated 50 to 80 million people are descendants of Irish people , primarily in the United Kingdom , the United States , Australia , Canada and Iceland ; there are also smaller numbers in Argentina , Chile , Mexico , Jamaica , Barbados , South Africa , New Zealand , France , Germany and Brazil .
The largest number of descendants of Irish people live in the United States .
The number of people living in Australia who are of Irish descent is higher , as a percentage of total population , than that of any other country .
Approximately forty percent of the settlement population of Iceland came from Ireland or Scotland .
The very first inhabitants of Iceland were Irish .
who made hubble telescope
The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 and remains in operation .
A aperture telescope in low Earth orbit , Hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared .
The telescope is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble .
Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light .
Hubble 's Deep Field have been some of the most detailed visible-light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time .
Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe .
Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy .
The HST was built by the United States space agency NASA , with contributions from the European Space Agency , and is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute .
The HST is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope .
Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 .
Hubble was funded in the 1970s , with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the Challenger disaster .
When finally launched in 1990 , scientists found that the main mirror had been ground incorrectly , compromising the telescope 's capabilities .
The telescope was restored to its intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993 .
Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts .
Between 1993 and 2002 , four missions repaired , upgraded , and replaced systems on the telescope ; a fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster .
However , after spirited public discussion , NASA administrator Mike Griffin approved one final servicing mission , completed in 2009 by Space Shuttle Atlantis .
The telescope is now expected to function until at least 2013 .
Its scientific successor , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , is to be launched in 2018 or possibly later .
what are anti inflammatories
Anti-inflammatory refers to the property of a substance or treatment that reduces inflammation .
Anti-inflammatory drugs make up about half of analgesics , remedying pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to opioids , which affect the central nervous system .
when tonight show first started in 1962 everyone did this on camera
The Tonight Show is a US late-night talk show that has aired on NBC since 1954 .
It is the longest currently running regularly scheduled entertainment program in the US and the third longest-running show on NBC after Meet the Press and Today .
The Tonight Show was hosted by Steve Allen ( 1954–1957 ) , Jack Paar ( 1957–1962 ) , Johnny Carson ( 1962–1992 ) , Jay Leno ( 1992–2009 , 2010–present ) , and Conan O'Brien ( 2009–2010 ) .
Several guest hosts also appeared , particularly during the Paar and Carson eras .
The longest-serving host to date was Johnny Carson , who hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson for 30 seasons from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1992 .
The current host of the show is Jay Leno , who had previously hosted the show from 1992 to 2009 and began his second tenure on March 1 , 2010 .
On April 3 , 2013 , NBC announced Jimmy Fallon would become the new host of The Tonight Show .
The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon will premiere February 24 , 2014 , the day after the closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics .
when did andrea doria sink
SS Andrea Doria .
Pronounced was an ocean liner for the Italian Line ( Società di navigazione Italia ) home ported in Genoa , Italy , most famous for its sinking in 1956 , when 52 people died ( 51 from immediate impact ) .
Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria , the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew .
For a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after World War II , Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride .
Of all Italy 's ships at the time , Andrea Doria was the largest , fastest and supposedly safest .
Launched on 16 June 1951 , the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953 .
On 25 July 1956 , while the Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket , Massachusetts , bound for New York City , the eastbound of the Swedish American Line collided with it in what became one of history 's most infamous maritime disasters .
Struck in the side , the top-heavy Andrea Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard , which left half of its lifeboats unusable .
The consequent shortage of lifeboats might have resulted in significant loss of life , but the efficiency of the ship 's technical design allowed it to stay afloat for over 11 hours after the ramming .
The good behavior of the crew , improvements in communications and the rapid response of other ships averted a disaster similar in scale to that of the in 1912 .
1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived , while 46 people died as a consequence of the collision .
The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning .
This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of the in 1915 .
The incident and its aftermath were heavily covered by the news media .
While the rescue efforts were both successful and commendable , the cause of the collision with the Stockholm and the loss of Andrea Doria generated much interest in the media and many lawsuits .
Largely because of an out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies during hearings immediately after the disaster , no determination of the cause ( s ) was ever formally published .
Although greater blame appeared initially to fall on the Italian liner , more recent discoveries have indicated that a misreading of radar on the Swedish ship may have initiated the collision course , leading to errors on both ships .
Andrea Doria was the last major transatlantic passenger vessel to sink before aircraft became the preferred method of travel .
what are dialysis tubes
Dialysis tubing
Dialysis tubing is a type of semi- or partially permeable membrane tubing made from regenerated cellulose or cellophane .
It can be used for diffusion with solutes or osmosis if used with water only .
Osmosis is when water passes through a semi-permeable layer to reach equilibrium .
Diffusion , on the other hand , allows the movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration .
It will only allow molecules to pass through a semi-permeable membrane or layer if the molecule is small enough to fit through the membrane or a membrane 's pore .
This usually results with the effects of diffusion through a membrane only really affects small molecules , and almost never larger molecules .
Dialysis tubing is used in clinical circumstances to ensure a filtered flow of molecules , preventing the flow of larger solute molecules .
Small molecules can be `` washed '' out of a solution which is pumped through the tubing into a solvent , usually water , which surrounds it and in which they can be flushed away .
In demonstrations of semi-permeable membranes , a solution containing several types of molecules , usually glucose and starch , is placed into a semi-permeable dialysis bag , such as a cellulose membrane with pores , and the bag is sealed with a knot or elastic band .
The sealed dialysis bag is placed in a container of a different solution , or water .
Molecules small enough to pass through the tubing ( water , salts , monosaccharides , and other small molecules ) tend to move into or out of the dialysis bag in the direction of decreasing concentration , therefore displaying diffusion .
Larger molecules ( such as proteins , or polysaccharides ) that have dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag .
The water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic solution ( a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to ) will cross a semi-permeable membrane , like dialysis tubing , into a hypertonic solution ( a solution that has a higher solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to ) in an attempt to reach equilibrium , where the solute concentration of each solution is in equilibrium .
who invented the thermometer
Mercury laboratory thermometer
A thermometer ( from the Greek , thermos , meaning `` hot '' and μἐτρον , metron , `` measure '' ) is a device that measures temperature or temperature gradient using a variety of different principles .
A thermometer has two important elements : the temperature sensor ( e.g . the bulb on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ) in which some physical change occurs with temperature , plus some means of converting this physical change into a numerical value ( e.g . the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ) .
There are many types and many uses for thermometers , as detailed below in sections of this article .
what are the names of the 7 dwarfs
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures .
Based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm , it is the first full-length cel animated feature film and the earliest in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series .
The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank , Richard Creedon , Merrill De Maris , Otto Englander , Earl Hurd , Dick Rickard , Ted Sears and Webb Smith .
David Hand was the supervising director , while William Cottrell , Wilfred Jackson , Larry Morey , Perce Pearce , and Ben Sharpsteen directed the film 's individual sequences .
Snow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21 , 1937 , followed by a nationwide release on February 4 , 1938 , and with international earnings of $ 8 million during its initial release briefly assumed the record of highest grossing sound film at the time .
The popularity of the film has led to it being re-released theatrically many times , until its home video release in the 1990s .
Adjusted for inflation , it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office .
At the 11th Academy Awards , Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar , and the film was nominated for Best Musical Score .
It was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1989 and is ranked in the American Film Institute 's list of the 100 greatest American films , who also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008 .
Disney 's take on the fairy tale has had a big cultural impact , resulting in a popular theme park attraction , a video game , and a Broadway musical .
what is a cervix childbirth
Childbirth , labour , delivery , birth , partus , or parturition is the culmination of a pregnancy period with the expulsion of one or more newborn infants from a woman 's uterus .
The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour : the shortening and dilation of the cervix , descent and birth of the infant , and birth of the placenta .
In many cases and with increasing frequency , childbirth is achieved through induction of labor or caesarean section , which is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen , rather than through vaginal birth .
Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50 % in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006 , and comprise nearly 32 % of births in the U.S. and Canada .
With respect to induced labor , more than 22 % of women undergo induction of labour in the United States .
Medical professional policy makers find that induced births and elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother , and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks .
What songs were used in the Viva La Bam episode Raab 's Russian Mail Order Bride
Viva La Bam was an MTV & Viva show which followed Bam Margera and his crew as they undertook challenges , performed stunts and traveled the world .
The show ran for 5 seasons between 2003 and 2005 .

when did boston braves move
The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta .
The Braves are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball 's National League .
The Braves have played in Turner Field since 1997 .
The `` Braves '' name , which was first used in 1912 , originates from a term for a Native American warrior .
They are nicknamed `` the Bravos '' , and often referred to as `` America 's Team `` in reference to the team 's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007 , gaining a wide fanbase .
From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball , winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period ( omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions ) .
The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005 , and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010 .
The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s , winning the title in 1995 .
Since their debut in the National League in 1876 , the franchise has won 16 divisional titles , 17 National League pennants , as well as three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves , in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves , and in 1995 in Atlanta .
The Braves are the only MLB franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities .
The club is one of the National League 's two remaining charter franchises ( the other being the Chicago Cubs ) and was founded in Boston , Massachusetts , in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings ( not to be confused with the American League 's Boston Red Sox ) .
They are considered `` the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports . ''
There is an argument as to who is actually older because although the Cubs are a full season `` older '' ( formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870 ) Chicago lost two seasons to the Great Chicago Fire , thus the Braves have played more consecutive seasons .
After various name changes ( such as the Boston Beaneaters ) , the team operated as the Boston Braves for most of the first half of the 20th century .
In 1953 , the team moved to Milwaukee , Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves , followed by the move to Atlanta in 1966 .
The team 's tenure in Atlanta is famous for Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth 's career home run record in 1974 , though the majority of Aaron 's home runs were hit while the team was in Milwaukee .
His record stood until 2007 , when San Francisco left fielder Barry Bonds broke the record .
what are leaf lobe
The leaves of a Beech tree
3D rendering of a μCT scan of a leaf piece , resolution circa 40 μm/ voxel .
A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant , as defined in botanical terms , and in particular in plant morphology .
Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature of plants .
Typically a leaf is a thin , flattened organ borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis , but many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms : some are not flat ( for example many succulent leaves and conifers ) , some are not above ground ( such as bulb scales ) , and some are without major photosynthetic function ( consider for example cataphylls , spines , and cotyledons ) .
Conversely , many structures of non-vascular plants , or even of some lichens , which are not plants at all ( in the sense of being members of the kingdom Plantae ) , do look and function much like leaves .
Furthermore , several structures found in vascular plants look like leaves but are not actually leaves ; they differ from leaves in their structures and origins .
Examples include phyllodes , cladodes , and phylloclades .
Who played Spanky on Little Rascals
Title card for the 1937 Our Gang comedy Rushin ' Ballet .
Our Gang ( also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures .
Created by comedy producer Hal Roach , the series is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way , as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected , raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles .
In addition , Our Gang notably put boys , girls , whites and blacks together in a group as equals , something that `` broke new ground , '' according to film historian Leonard Maltin .
Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since been repeated after the success of Our Gang .
The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects .
When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927 , and converted the series to sound in 1929 , the series took off even further .
Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938 , when the series was sold to MGM , who then continued producing the comedies until 1944 .
The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film , General Spanky , featuring over forty-one child actors .
As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights , the 80 Roach-produced `` talkies '' were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955 .
Both Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment ) have since remained in syndication , with periodic new productions based on the shorts surfacing over the years , including a 1994 Little Rascals feature film released by Universal Pictures .
when did zacharias janssen make a discovery related to the cell theory
Zacharias Janssen ( also Zacharias Jansen or Sacharias Jansen ) ( b.1580-88 , d.pre-1632 to 1638 ) was a Dutch spectacle-maker from Middelburg associated with the invention of the first optical telescope .
Janssen is sometimes also credited for inventing the first truly compound microscope .
However , the origin of the microscope , just like the origin of the telescope , is a matter of debate .

when they came for the jews
“First they came ... ” is a famous statement and provocative poem attributed to pastor Martin Niemöller ( 1892–1984 ) about the sloth of German intellectuals following the Nazis ' rise to power and the subsequent purging of their chosen targets , group after group .
There is some disagreement over the exact wording of the quotation and when it was created ; the content of the quotation may have been presented differently by Niemöller on different occasions .

what are four thirds cameras
Four Thirds logo
The Four Thirds system is a standard created by Olympus and Kodak for digital single-lens reflex camera ( DSLR ) design and development. < ref name='DPReview.com 2001-02-13 ' >
The system provides a standard that , with digital cameras and lenses available from multiple manufacturers , allows for the interchange of lenses and bodies from different manufacturers .
seems to cover the standard .
Proponents describe it as an open standard , but companies may only use it under a non-disclosure agreement .
Unlike older SLR systems , Four Thirds has been designed from the ground up to be entirely digital .
Many lenses are extensively computerized , to the point that Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them .
Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors , most notably through telecentric designs .
The size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most DSLRs and this implies that lenses , especially telephoto lenses , can be smaller .
For example , a Four Thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard , and is correspondingly more compact .
Thus , the Four Thirds System has crop factor ( focal length multiplier ) of about 2 , and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification , it does n't aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses .
The image sensor format , generally intermediate between those of larger SLRs and smaller compact cameras , generally gives levels of cost , performance and convenience intermediate between those two classes .
what is a HVAC company
HVAC systems use ventilation air ducts installed throughout a building to supply conditioned air to a room through outlet vents , called diffusers ; and ducts to remove air through return-air grilles .
HVAC ( heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ) is the technology of indoor and automotive environmental comfort .
HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering , based on the principles of thermodynamics , fluid mechanics , and heat transfer .
Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field 's abbreviation as HVAC & R or HVACR , or ventilating is dropped as in HACR ( such as the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers ) .
HVAC is important in the design of medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and in marine environments such as aquariums , where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity , using fresh air from outdoors .
Ventilation on the downdraught system , by impulsion , or the 'plenum ' principle , applied to schoolrooms ( 1899 )
Heating , ventilating , and air conditioning is based on inventions and discoveries made by Nikolay Lvov , Michael Faraday , Willis Carrier , Reuben Trane , James Joule , William Rankine , Sadi Carnot , and many others .
The invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the industrial revolution , and new methods of modernization , higher efficiency , and system control are constantly introduced by companies and inventors worldwide .
The three central functions of heating , ventilating , and air-conditioning are interrelated , especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation , operation , and maintenance costs .
HVAC systems can provide ventilation , reduce air infiltration , and maintain pressure relationships between spaces .
The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as room air distribution .
The starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions .
However before taking up the heat load calculation , it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail , as pressurization is an important consideration .
In modern buildings the design , installation , and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems .
For very small buildings , contractors normally capacity engineer and select HVAC systems and equipment .
For larger buildings , building services designers and engineers , such as mechanical , architectural , or building services engineers analyze , design , and specify the HVAC systems , and specialty mechanical contractors fabricate and commission them .
Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of buildings .
The HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise , with roles including operation and maintenance , system design and construction , equipment manufacturing and sales , and in education and research .
The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment , but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI , ASHRAE , SMACNA , ACCA , Uniform Mechanical Code , International Mechanical Code , and AMCA have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement .
who did james bond work for
Royal Navy Commander James Bond , CMG , RNVR , is a fictional character created by British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1953 .
He is the protagonist of the James Bond series of novels , films , comics and video games .
Fleming wrote twelve Bond novels and two short story collections before his death , although the last two books— The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights —were published posthumously .
The Bond character is a Secret Service agent , code number 007 , residing in London but active internationally .
Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II , to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes ; Bond 's name was appropriated from American ornithologist James Bond .
Bond has a number of character traits which run throughout the books , including an enjoyment of cars , a love of food and drink , and an average intake of sixty custom-made cigarettes a day .
Since Fleming 's death in 1964 , there have been other authorised writers of Bond material , including John Gardner , who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations and Raymond Benson , who wrote six novels , three novelizations and three short stories .
There have also been three authors who wrote one book each , Kingsley Amis ( writing as Robert Markham ) , Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver .
Additionally a series of novels based on Bond 's youth— Young Bond —was written by Charlie Higson .
As spin-offs from the literary works , there was a television adaptation of the first novel , Casino Royale , in which Bond was played as an American agent .
A comic strip series also ran in the Daily Express newspaper .
There have also been twenty-five Bond films ; seven actors have played Bond in these films .
who wrote nature boy
`` Nature Boy '' is a song by Eden Ahbez , published in 1947 .
The song tells a fantasy of a `` strange enchanted boy ... who wandered very far '' only to learn that `` the greatest thing ... was just to love and be loved in return '' .
Nat King Cole 's 1948 recording of the song was a major hit and `` Nature Boy '' has since become a pop and jazz standard , with dozens of major artists interpreting the song .
what numbers the louisiana
Louisiana ( or ; , ; Louisiana Creole : Léta de la Lwizyàn ) is a state located in the southern region of the United States of America .
Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States .
Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans .
Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes , which are local government 's equivalent to counties .
The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish , and the largest by land area is Cameron Parish .
Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp .
These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets .
There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish .
In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape , and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas .
These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants .
Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural , multilingual heritage , being so strongly influenced by an admixture of 18th-century French , Spanish , Native American ( Indian ) and African cultures that they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U.S .
Before the American purchase of the territory , the current Louisiana State had been both a Spanish and French colony .
In addition , the pattern of development included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century , with many from the same region of West Africa , thus concentrating their culture .
In the post-Civil War environment , Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization , and in 1915 , English was made the only official language of the state .
when did women get the right to own property
Women 's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide .
In some places these rights are institutionalized or supported by law , local custom , and behaviour , whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed .
They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in favour of men and boys .
Issues commonly associated with notions of women 's rights include , though are not limited to , the right : to bodily integrity and autonomy ; to vote ( suffrage ) ; to hold public office ; to work ; to fair wages or equal pay ; to own property ; to education ; to serve in the military or be conscripted ; to enter into legal contracts ; and to have marital , parental and religious rights .
what are the top three laws in science
The laws of science or scientific laws are statements that describe , predict , and perhaps explain why , a range of phenomena behave as they appear to in nature .
The term `` law '' has diverse usage in many cases : approximate , accurate , broad or narrow theories , in all natural scientific disciplines ( physics , chemistry , biology , geology , astronomy etc . ) .
An analogous term for a scientific law is a principle .
Scientific laws:
summarize a large collection of facts determined by experiment into a single statement,
can usually be formulated mathematically as one or several statements or equation , or at least stated in a single sentence , so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment , given the initial , boundary , and other physical conditions of the processes which take place,
are strongly supported by empirical evidence - they are scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified ( and never falsified ) .
Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out , but rather the scope of application , since the equation ( if any ) representing the law does not change .
As with other scientific knowledge , they do not have absolute certainty like mathematical theorems or identities , and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations .
are often quoted as a fundamental controlling influence rather than a description of observed facts .
I.e . `` the laws of motion require that ''
Laws differ from hypotheses and postulates , which are proposed during the scientific process before and during validation by experiment and observation .
These are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general , although they may lead to the formulation of laws .
A law is a more solidified and formal statement , distilled from repeated experiment .
Although the concepts of a law or principle in nature is borderline to philosophy , and presents the depth to which mathematics can describe nature , scientific laws are considered from a scientific perspective and follow the scientific method ; they `` serve their purpose '' rather than `` questioning reality '' ( philosophical ) or `` statements of logical absolution '' ( mathematical ) .
For example , whether a law `` refers to reality '' is a philosophical issue , rather than scientific .
Fundamentally , all scientific laws follow from physics , laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from physical laws .
Often , from mathematically fundamental viewpoints , universal constants emerge from scientific laws .
when did playstation 3 first launch
The launch of the PlayStation 3 into the Japanese market on 10 November 2006 marked the second major seventh generation entertainment system to be released .
The system was released seven days later on 17 November in the United States .

where does ground pepper come from
Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning .
The fruit , known as a peppercorn when dried , is approximately in diameter , dark red when fully mature , and , like all drupes , contains a single seed .
Peppercorns , and the ground pepper derived from them , may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper ( cooked and dried unripe fruit ) , green pepper ( dried unripe fruit ) and white pepper ( dried ripe seeds ) .
Black pepper is native to south India , and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions .
Currently Vietnam is the world 's largest producer and exporter of pepper , producing 34 % of the world 's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008 .
Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavour and as a medicine .
Black pepper is the world 's most traded spice .
It is one of the most common spices added to European cuisine and its descendants .
The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine , not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs .
It is in the modern world , often paired with salt .
what is a normal ejection fraction
In cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction ( EF ) represents the volumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle ( heart ) with each heart beat or cardiac cycle .
It can be applied to either the right ventricle which ejects via the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary circulation or the left ventricle which ejects via the aortic valve into the systemic circulation .
Imaging of the physiology of the mammalian heart is the art that allows meaningful mathematical expression defining EF .
Noninvasive cardiac imaging has become a worldwide utility enabling study of cardiac performance reproducibly and inexpensively .
Simplified , Ejection fraction is a mathematical product allowed by cardiac imaging .
As a mathematical term , Ejection Fraction is an extension of the work of Adolph Fick in cardiac output .
Dedicated technology such as Echocardiography , Computed Tomography , Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MUGA scanning have definitively allowed clinically relevant mathematics regarding Ischemia , Congenital Heart Disease and Heart Failure .
where do prosecutors get evidence for criminal court
The prosecutor is the chief legal representative of the prosecution in countries with either the common law adversarial system , or the civil law inquisitorial system .

who contacted muhammad
Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim ( ) ( circa| 570 – circa| 8 June 632 ) , also transliterated as Muhammad ( ) , was a religious , political , and military leader from Mecca who unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam .
He is believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God .
Muhammad is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God for mankind .
Non-Muslims regard Muhammad as the founder of Islam .
Muslims consider him to be the restorer of an unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets .
Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca , he was orphaned at an early age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib .
He later worked mostly as a merchant , as well as a shepherd , and was first married by age 25 .
Being in the habit of periodically retreating to a cave in the surrounding mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer , he later reported that it was there , at age 40 , that he received his first revelation from God .
Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that `` God is One `` , that complete `` surrender '' to Him ( lit .
islām ) is the only way ( dīn ) acceptable to God , and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God , in the same vein as other Islamic prophets .
Muhammad gained few followers early on , and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes ; he and his followers were treated harshly .
To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in the year 622 .
This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , which is also known as the Hijri Calendar .
In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina .
After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes , his followers , who by then had grown to 10,000 , took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca .
He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and then sent his followers out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia .
In 632 , a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage , Muhammad fell ill and died .
By the time of his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam , and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity .
The revelations ( or Ayah , lit .
`` Signs [ of God ] '' ) — which Muhammad reported receiving until his death – form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the religion is based .
Besides the Quran , Muhammad 's life ( sira ) and traditions ( sunnah ) are also upheld by Muslims as the sources of sharia law .
They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence , adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned .
While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times were largely negative , appraisals in modern history have been far less so .
who wrote the famous novel Great books of the western world volume 27 ?
The Great Books ( second edition )
Great Books of the Western World is a series of books originally published in the United States in 1952 by Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. to present the Great Books in a single package of 54 volumes .
The series is now in its second edition and contains 60 volumes .
The original editors of the series chose three criteria for inclusion : a book must be relevant to contemporary issues , and not only important in its historical context ; it must reward rereading ; and it must be a part of `` the great conversation about the great ideas , '' relevant to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas identified by the editors .
Books were not chosen on the basis of ethnic or cultural inclusiveness , historical influence , or the editors ' agreement with the views expressed .
who wrote the song cocaine
`` Cocaine '' is a song written and recorded by JJ Cale in 1976 , but also known as a cover version recorded by Eric Clapton .
Allmusic calls the latter `` among [ Clapton 's ] most enduringly popular hits '' and notes that `` even for an artist like Clapton with a huge body of high-quality work , 'Cocaine ' ranks among his best . ''
Glyn Johns , who had previously worked with The Who , Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones , produced the Clapton recording , which was released on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand and as a single in 1980 .
The live version of `` Cocaine '' , from the Just One Night album recorded in Tokyo , charted on the Billboard Hot 100 as the B-side of `` Tulsa Time `` , which was a No . 30 hit in 1980. ``
Cocaine '' was one of several of Cale 's songs recorded by Clapton , including `` After Midnight `` and `` Travelin ' Light '' .
when did pearl harbor get bombed
The attack on Pearl Harbor ( called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning ) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor ) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , on the morning of December 7 , 1941 ( December 8 in Japan ) .
From the standpoint of the defenders , the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time .
The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States .
The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters , bombers and torpedo planes in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .
All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four being sunk .
Two of these were later raised , and with the remaining four repaired , six battleships returned to service later in the war .
The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer .
188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded .
Important base installations such as the power station , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked .
Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 65 servicemen killed or wounded .
One Japanese sailor was captured .
The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters .
The following day ( December 8 ) , the United States declared war on Japan .
Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong , disappeared .
Clandestine support of Britain ( for example the Neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance .
Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11 , which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day .
There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan .
However , the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy `` .
who won season 2 of project runway
Project Runway Season 2 was the second season of Bravo 's successful Project Runway , a reality competition for fashion designers .
Season 2 began airing on December 7 , 2005 .
Following a nationwide search earlier in the year , sixteen designers were chosen as semi-finalists and brought to New York City in June , 2005 .
After the first challenge , called `` Road To The Runway '' , fourteen went on to compete as finalists .
The winning designer , Chloe Dao , received $ 100,000 in seed money to help launch her own line , a 2007 Saturn Sky roadster , a spread in ELLE magazine , and a mentorship with the Banana Republic Design Team .
Winning alongside Dao was her model , Grace Kelsey , who received the ELLE Magazine spread .
Michael Kors and Nina Garcia returned as judges for the second season .
The fourth judging seat rotated each week , based on the challenge .
Tim Gunn , fashion chair at Parsons The New School for Design , returned as a mentor for the designers .
Kara Janx later appeared in Project Runway : All Stars in 2012 , where she finished 7th out of 13 .
Andrae Gonzalo , in the same year , competed in the second season of the All Stars edition placing 10th out of 13 .
what is a mule in coins
An example of a Heraclius mule
In numismatics , a mule is a coin or medal minted with obverse and reverse designs not normally seen on the same piece .
These can be intentional or produced by error .
This type of error is highly sought after , and examples can fetch steep prices from collectors .
The earliest mules are found among ancient Greek and Roman coins .
Opinion is divided between those who think that they are accidental , the result of an incorrect combination of a new die with one that had officially been withdrawn from use , or the work of coiners working with dies stolen from an official mint , perhaps at a time when one of them should have been destroyed .
The name derives from the mule , the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey , due to such a coin having two sides intended for different coins , much as a mule has parents of two different species .
what time did the dallas september 8 , 2010 tornado hit

what versions of windows do not have powershell
Windows PowerShell is Microsoft 's task automation framework , consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on .NET Framework .
PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI , enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems .
In PowerShell , administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets ( pronounced command-lets ) , which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation .
Sets of cmdlets may be combined together in scripts , executables ( which are standalone applications ) , or by instantiating regular .NET classes ( or WMI/COM Objects ) .
These work by accessing data in different data stores , like the filesystem or registry , which are made available to the PowerShell runtime via Windows PowerShell providers .
Windows PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the Windows PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications .
These applications can then use Windows PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations , including those exposed via the graphical interface .
This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets .
Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets .
With PowerShell , graphical interface-based management applications on Windows are layered on top of Windows PowerShell .
A PowerShell scripting interface for Windows products is mandated by the Common Engineering Criteria .
Windows PowerShell includes its own extensive , console-based help , similar to man pages in Unix shells , via the Get-Help cmdlet .

what is an arc in a story plot
A story arc is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television , comic books , comic strips , boardgames , video games , and in some cases , films .
On a television program , for example , the story would unfold over many episodes .
In television , the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies , especially in soap operas .
Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics , as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on .
Although story arcs have existed for decades , the term `` story arc '' was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series Wiseguy , and was quickly adapted for other uses .
Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs , within a continuing series .
Short story arcs are easier to package as trade paperbacks for resale , and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending continuity that once characterised comics .
when does black friday start for christmas
Black Friday is the day following Thanksgiving Day in the United States , often regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season .
In recent years , most major retailers have opened extremely early and offered promotional sales to kick off the holiday shopping season , similar to Boxing Day sales in many Commonwealth Nations .
Black Friday is not an official public holiday as such , but many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the day after off , followed by a weekend , thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers .
It has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005 , although news reports , which at that time were inaccurate , have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time .
The day 's name originated in Philadelphia , where it originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on the day after Thanksgiving .
Use of the term started before 1961 and began to see broader use outside Philadelphia around 1975 .
Later an alternative explanation began to be offered : that `` Black Friday '' indicates the point at which retailers begin to turn a profit , or are `` '' .
For many years , it was common for retailers to open at 6:00 a.m. , but in the late 2000s many had crept to 5:00 or even 4:00 .
This was taken to a new extreme in 2011 , when several retailers ( including Target , Kohl 's , Macy 's , Best Buy , and Bealls ) opened at midnight for the first time .
In 2012 , Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day ( except in states where opening on Thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws , such as Massachusetts where they still opened around midnight ) , prompting calls for a walkout among some workers .
Black Friday shopping is known for attracting aggressive crowds , with annual reports of assaults , shootings , and throngs of people trampling on other shoppers in an attempt to get the best deal on a product before supplies run out .

what other territories did the english sharing the island of st kitts
Roadtown , Tortola
The British West Indies were the islands in and around the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire .
In 1912 , the British West Indies were divided into eight colonies : The Bahamas , Barbados , British Guiana , British Honduras , Jamaica ( with its dependencies the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands ) , Trinidad and Tobago , the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands .
Between 1958 and 1962 , all of the island territories except the British Virgin Islands , the Bahamas , British Honduras and British Guiana were organised into the West Indies Federation .
It was hoped that the Federation would become independent as a single nation , but it had limited powers , many practical problems , and a lack of popular support .
Consequently , the West Indies Federation was dissolved .
Most of the territories , including all the larger ones , are now independent as separate countries , with membership to many international forums such as the Organization of American States , the Association of Caribbean States , the World Trade Organization , the United Nations , the Caribbean Community , the Commonwealth of Nations and the Caribbean Development Bank among others .
The remainder are British overseas territories .
All the former nations of the British West Indies , except the Commonwealth of Dominica , Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago , are Commonwealth Realms .
The term is still used for British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean , such as the Cayman Islands .
The remaining British West Indies

what month is the president inaugurated
Inauguration Day 2009 on the west steps of the U.S. Capitol .
President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush lead the inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House , 2005
The inauguration of the president of the United States is a ceremonial event marking the commencement of a new four-year term of a president of the United States .
The day a presidential inauguration occurs is known as `` Inauguration Day '' and occurs on January 20 ( or 21st if the 20th is a Sunday ) .
( Prior to the Twentieth Amendment , the date was March 4 , the day of the year on which the Constitution of the United States first took effect in 1789 ; the last inauguration to take place on the older date was Franklin D. Roosevelt 's first one on March 4 , 1933 . )
The most recent public presidential inauguration ceremony , the swearing in of President Barack Obama to begin his second four-year term in office , took place on Monday , January 21 , 2013 .
The only inauguration element mandated by the United States Constitution is that the president make an oath or affirmation before that person can `` enter on the Execution '' of the office of the presidency .
However , over the years , various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event , including parades , speeches , and balls .
From the presidency of Andrew Jackson through that of Jimmy Carter , the primary Inauguration Day ceremony took place on the Capitol 's East Portico .
Since the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan , the ceremony has been held at the Capitol 's West Front .
The inaugurations of William Howard Taft in 1909 and Reagan in 1985 were moved indoors at the Capitol due to cold weather .
The War of 1812 and World War II caused two inaugurations to be held at other locations in Washington , D.C .
When George Washington was inaugurated , the oath was administered by Robert Livingston , Chancellor of New York State , in 1789 , and by William Cushing , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , in 1793 .
Since Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth swore in President John Adams , no chief justice has missed an Inauguration Day .
When Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday , the chief justice has administered the oath to the president on the Sunday privately and then again the next day publicly .
When a new president takes over mid-term due to the death or resignation of a president , the oath of office is administered but formal , public inauguration events have not been held .

what movement was elizabeth cady stanton a part of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her daughter , Harriot
Elizabeth Cady Stanton ( November 12 , 1815 – October 26 , 1902 ) was an American social activist , abolitionist , and leading figure of the early women 's rights movement .
Her Declaration of Sentiments , presented at the first women 's rights convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls , New York , is often credited with initiating the first organized women 's rights and women 's suffrage movements in the United States .
Before Stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women 's rights , she was an active abolitionist together with her husband , Henry Brewster Stanton and cousin , Gerrit Smith .
Unlike many of those involved in the women 's rights movement , Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights .
Her concerns included women 's parental and custody rights , property rights , employment and income rights , divorce , the economic health of the family , and birth control .
She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement .
After the American Civil War , Stanton 's commitment to female suffrage caused a schism in the women 's rights movement when she , together with Susan B. Anthony , declined to support passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution .
She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women , black and white , were denied those same rights .
Her position on this issue , together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women 's issues beyond voting rights , led to the formation of two separate women 's rights organizations that were finally rejoined , with Stanton as president of the joint organization , approximately twenty years after her break from the original women 's suffrage movement .
Stanton died in 1902 having authored both The Woman 's Bible and her autobiography , along with many articles and pamphlets concerning female suffrage and women 's rights .

what percent of total energy is solar energy
The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day .
Solar energy , radiant light and heat from the sun , has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies .
Solar energy technologies include solar heating , solar photovoltaics , solar thermal electricity , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis , which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent energy problems the world now faces .
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute solar energy .
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy .
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air .
In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits .
It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating climate change , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise .
These advantages are global .
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared '' .
where latin
The classical Latin alphabet or Roman alphabet evolved from a western variety of the Greek alphabet called the Cumaean alphabet , which was adopted and modified by the Etruscans who ruled early Rome .
The Etruscan alphabet was in turn adopted and further modified by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language .
During the Middle Ages , the Latin alphabet was adapted to Romance languages , direct descendants of Latin , as well as to Celtic , Germanic , Baltic , and some Slavic languages .
With the age of colonialism and Christian evangelism , the Latin script was spread overseas , and applied to indigenous American , Australian , Austronesian , Austroasiatic , and African languages .
More recently , linguists have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet ( itself largely based on Latin script ) when transcribing or creating written standards for non-European languages , such as the African reference alphabet .
The term Latin alphabet may refer to either the alphabet used to write Latin ( as described in this article ) , or other alphabets based on the Latin script , which is the basic set of letters common to the various alphabets descended from the classical Latin one , such as the English alphabet .
These Latin-derived alphabets may discard letters , like the Rotokas alphabet , or add new letters , like the Danish and Norwegian alphabet .
Letter shapes have changed over the centuries , including the creation for Medieval Latin of lower case forms which did not exist in the Classical period .
who shot abraham lincoln
The assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln took place on Good Friday , April 14 , 1865 , as the American Civil War was drawing to a close .
The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia , General Robert E. Lee , surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac .
Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated , though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835 .
The assassination was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth , as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause .
Booth 's co-conspirators were Lewis Powell and David Herold , who were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt who was to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson .
By simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration , Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government .
Lincoln was shot while watching the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford 's Theatre in Washington , D.C. on the night of April 14 , 1865 .
He died early the next morning .
The rest of the conspirators ' plot failed ; Powell only managed to wound Seward , while Atzerodt , Johnson 's would-be assassin , lost his nerve and fled Washington .

what are club seats
Club level seating is a special section of seating in modern sports stadiums .
The Club Level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections , above the lower deck but below the upper deck .
They are usually right next to the Luxury Boxes , either right above , right below , or sandwiched between two levels of Luxury Boxes .
Club Level seating is considered as higher class than sitting anywhere else in the arena , but lower class compared to the Luxury Boxes .
Unlike the Luxury Boxes , most club levels do not wrap entirely around the arena .
Some club levels stop at a certain point , giving way to an expansion of the Mezzanine , while others give way to lower class Luxury Boxes ( such as `` Party Suites '' ) .
A notable exception to this is Emirates Stadium in London , which has a complete tier of club seating .
Club Levels allow fans multiple levels of entertainment .
Club Level seating is open to the elements , as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes , which gives more of an outdoors impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas .
Club Level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the stadium .
The Club Level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the arena exclusive to fans with special tickets .
These areas are air conditioned and allow access to special restaurants , merchandise stands , and lounge areas of the stadium that are not otherwise available .
Concession stands and vendors on the Club Level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the Club .
These areas are closed off to the rest of the stadium , and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive , private club entrances .

what percentage of england is christian
Westminster Abbey is used for the coronation of British monarchs
Religion in the United Kingdom and in the countries that preceded it , has been dominated , for over 1,400 years , by various forms of Christianity .
According to some surveys , a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity , although regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century , and immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths .
Religious affiliations of UK citizens are recorded by regular surveys , the four major ones being the UK Census , the Labour Force Survey , the British Social Attitudes survey and the European Social Survey .
According to the 2001 UK census , Christianity is the major religion , followed by Islam , Hinduism , Sikhism , Judaism and Buddhism in terms of number of adherents .
This , and the relatively large number of individuals with nominal or no religious affiliations has led commentators to variously describe the United Kingdom as a multi-faith , secularised , or post-Christian society .
The United Kingdom was formed by the union of previously independent countries from 1707 , and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures .
While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom , others may have a single structure covering England and Wales or Great Britain .
Similarly , due to the relatively recent creation of Northern Ireland in 1921 , most major religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis .

what is a redshirt freshman football player
In United States college athletics , redshirt is a delay or suspension of an athlete 's participation in order to lengthen his or her period of eligibility .
Typically , a student 's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons , a number derived from the four years of academic classes that are normally required to obtain a bachelor 's degree at an American college or university .
However , a student athlete may be offered the opportunity to redshirt for up to two years , which allows the athlete to spread those four years of eligibility over five , or sometimes six years .
In a redshirt year , a student athlete may attend classes at the college or university , practice with an athletic team , and dress for play but he or she may not compete during the game .
Using this mechanism , a student athlete has up to five academic years to use the four years of eligibility , thus becoming a fifth-year senior .
The term is used as a verb , noun , and adjective .
For example , a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt freshman or simply a redshirt .
The opposite of this is a `` true freshman . ''

It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939 , and the First World War or World War I thereafter .
It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) .
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers .
Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
Within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .
While the Russians mobilised , the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France , providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany .
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans .
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai .
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916 .
In Russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers .
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front , the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches .
Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 .
The war ended in victory for the Allies .
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
By the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .
who rules communism government
Map of countries that declared themselves to be socialist states under the Marxist–Leninist or Maoist definition - that is to say , `` Communist states '' - between 1979 and 1983 .
This period marked the greatest territorial extent of Communist states .
A communist state is a state where the means of production are collectively owned by the society .
It has a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party ( referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents ) and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist–Leninist ideology as the guiding principle of the state .
Technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless .
From this perspective , the term Marxist-Leninist state is more appropriate .
Historically , a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today , a communist state can also , for instance , refer to contemporary China and Vietnam , where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy .
According to Marxist–Leninists , the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class , which in a socialist society is the working class , so a socialist state is , according to Leninists , a state of the working class .
In practice , communist states do not actually refer to themselves as such .
They do this not to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist , but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at present .
Instead , they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers ' states .
The primary goal of these states , which also explains their official name , is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism , ultimately leading to communism .
Communist states may have several legal political parties , but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government , often by statute or under the constitution .
Consequently , the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined , such as in the development of parallel institutions .
In the 20th century , most communist states adopted planned economies .
However , there were exceptions : The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management , while China , Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s .
In the 21st century , China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop .
The fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop .
As a result , many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states .
For example , dissenting communists such as Trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century , claiming either that they had nothing to do with `` real '' communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption .

what is a slugs slime made out of
Slug is a common name for an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusk .
The word `` slug '' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell , has a very reduced shell , or has only a small internal shell .
( This is in contrast to the common name `` snail `` , which is applied to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is large enough that the soft parts of the animal can retract fully into it . )
Slugs exist on land and in the sea , and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs , Acochlidium .
The unadorned word `` slug '' is however applied primarily to land slugs , whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as `` sea slugs `` and `` freshwater slugs '' .
Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial , but is too small to retract into ( like many in the family Urocyclidae ) , are known as semislugs .
The various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages which also include snails .
Thus , for example , the various families of land slugs are not very closely related to one another , despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form .
The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past , and thus the category `` slug '' is emphatically a polyphyletic one .
Slugs , like all other gastropods , undergo torsion ( a 180° twisting of the internal organs ) during development .
Internally , slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation , but externally the bodies of land slugs appear to be more or less symmetrical , except for the positioning of the pneumostome , which is on one side of the animal , normally the right hand side .
The soft , slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation , so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry .
The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs .

who overthrows france
Imperial Standard of Napoleon I
Napoleon Bonaparte ( , ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821 ) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe .
As Napoleon I , he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815 .
His legal reform , the Napoleonic Code , has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide , but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions , the so-called Napoleonic Wars .
He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution , while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed Ancien Régime .
Due to his success in these wars , often against numerically superior enemies , he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time , and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide .
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry which had settled Corsica in the 16th century .
He trained as an artillery officer in mainland France .
He rose to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions arrayed against France .
He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula .
In 1799 , he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor , following a plebiscite in his favour .
In the first decade of the 19th century , the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power .
After a streak of victories , France secured a dominant position in continental Europe , and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states .
The Peninsular War and 1812 French invasion of Russia marked turning points in Napoleon 's fortunes .
His Grande Armée was badly damaged in the campaign and never fully recovered .
In 1813 , the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig ; the following year the Coalition invaded France , forced Napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of Elba .
Less than a year later , he escaped Elba and returned to power , but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 .
Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint Helena .
An autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer , but there has been some debate about the cause of his death , as some scholars have speculated that he was a victim of arsenic poisoning .

what year did South Africa become a team in rugby
The South Africa national rugby union team ( known as the Springboks ) represents South Africa in rugby union .
They compete in the annual Rugby Championship , along with southern-hemisphere counterparts Argentina , Australia and New Zealand .
They have won this championship on three occasions in sixteen years .
They are currently ranked second in the world by the International Rugby Board , and were named 2008 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards .
Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition , the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of South Africa .
The team made its World Cup debut in 1995 , when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament .
The Springboks then defeated the All Blacks 15–12 in the final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa 's sporting history , and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process .
South Africa regained their title as champions 12 years later , when they defeated England 15–6 in the 2007 final .
As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankings , a position they held until July the following year when New Zealand regained the top spot .
The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys , and their emblems are the Springbok and the Protea .
The side has been playing international rugby since 1891 , when a British Isles side toured the nation , playing South Africa in their first Test on 30 July .
South Africa was coached by Jake White , who led the Boks to the 2007 World Cup title , announcing his resignation effectively from the end of 2007 .
His replacement 's ( Peter de Villiers ) contract expired in 2011 , following a 11–9 defeat to Australia in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final , who then stated he would not be signing a new deal .
The previous captain was John Smit , who before he retired in 2011 played hooker for most of his career , although he has also been a prop , mainly in 2008 and 2009 .
Due to Smit being unavailable for the November 2010 Tests after surgery , lock Victor Matfield took Smit 's place as captain for that tour .
The current captain is Jean de Villiers .
who jumped the fence at gettysburg during the civil war ?
The Battle of Gettysburg ( , with an sound ) , was fought July 1–3 , 1863 , in and around the town of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania .
It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war 's turning point .
Union Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , ending Lee 's invasion of the North .
After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign .
With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia .
Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade .
Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it .
Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry .
However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of town to the hills just to the south .
On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled .
The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .
In the late afternoon of July 2 , Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank , and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top , the Wheatfield , Devil 's Den , and the Peach Orchard .
On the Union right , demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp 's Hill and Cemetery Hill .
All across the battlefield , despite significant losses , the Union defenders held their lines .
On the third day of battle , July 3 , fighting resumed on Culp 's Hill , and cavalry battles raged to the east and south , but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge , known as Pickett 's Charge .
The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire , at great losses to the Confederate army .
Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia .
Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle .
That November , President Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the Gettysburg National Cemetery to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address .
what is a discipline of study
An academic discipline , or field of study , is a branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level .
Disciplines are defined ( in part ) , and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published , and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong .
However , there exists no formal criteria for when educational programs and scholarly journals form an academic discipline .
A huge difference exists between , on the one hand , well established disciplines that exist in almost all universities all over the world , have a long history , and have a well established set of journals and conferences , and , on the other hand , suggestions for new fields supported only by few universities and publications .
Fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches , and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous .
what is a php application
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language .
PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers .
Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 , the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group .
While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , it now stands for PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor , a recursive acronym .
PHP code is interpreted by a web server with a PHP processor module which generates the resulting web page : PHP commands can be embedded directly into an HTML source document rather than calling an external file to process data .
It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications .
PHP is free software released under the PHP License , which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) due to restrictions on the usage of the term PHP .
PHP can be deployed on most web servers and also as a standalone shell on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge .
who did john f kennedy run against ?
John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy ( May 29 , 1917 – November 22 , 1963 ) , often referred to by his initials JFK , was the 35th President of the United States , serving from 1961 until his death in 1963 .
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts ' 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat .
Thereafter , he served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960 .
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election .
At 43 years of age , he is the youngest to have been elected to the office , the second-youngest President ( after Theodore Roosevelt ) , and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president .
A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president , and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize .
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African-American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War .
Therein , Kennedy increased the number of military advisers , special operation forces , and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia .
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government .
It involved certain forced relocation , village internment , and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents .
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22 , 1963 in Dallas , Texas .
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime , but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later , before a trial could take place .
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin .
However , the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations ( HSCA ) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
However , ABC News in their investigation , The Kennedy Assassination : Beyond Conspiracy , confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission ; having concluded Oswald acted alone .
Kennedy 's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970 .
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy 's private life has come to light .
Details of Kennedy 's health problems in which he struggled have become better known , especially since the 1990s .
Although initially kept secret from the general public , reports of Kennedy 's philandering have garnered much press .
Kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of U.S. presidents .
who wrote stand by me
`` Stand by Me '' is a song originally performed by Ben E. King and written by King , Jerry Leiber , and Mike Stoller , inspired by the spiritual `` Lord Stand by Me , '' plus two lines rooted in Psalms 46:2–3 .
There have been over 400 recorded versions of the song .
what are metaphors used for
A political cartoon from an 1894 Puck magazine by illustrator S.D . Ehrhart , shows a farm woman labeled `` Democratic Party '' sheltering from a tornado of political change .
A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes a subject by asserting that it is , on some point of comparison , the same as another otherwise unrelated object .
Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association , comparison or resemblance including allegory , hyperbole , and simile .
In simpler terms , a metaphor compares two objects or things without using the words `` like '' or `` as '' .
One of the most prominent examples of a metaphor in English literature is the All the world 's a stage monologue from As You Like It :
All the world 's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players ;
They have their exits and their entrances ; — William Shakespeare , As You Like It , 2/7
This quote is a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage .
By figuratively asserting that the world is a stage , Shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the lives of the people within it .

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing , normally on paper .
Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints with an element of originality , rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting .
Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece , which is called a print .
Each print produced is not considered a `` copy '' but rather is considered an `` original '' .
This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process , and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique .
A print may be known as an impression .
Printmaking ( other than monotyping ) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions , but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to .
Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material .
Common types of matrices include : metal plates , usually copper or zinc , or polymer plates for engraving or etching ; stone , aluminum , or polymer for lithography ; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts .
Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screenprinting process .
Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below .
Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition .
Since the late 19th century , artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition .
Prints may also be printed in book form , such as illustrated books or artist 's books .

what is an aircraft interception
Su-15 , one of the principal Soviet Air Defence interceptors in the 1970s and 1980s
An interceptor aircraft ( or simply interceptor ) is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to prevent missions of enemy aircraft , particularly bombers and reconnaissance aircraft , and destroy them , relying usually on great speed and powerful armament .
Being used since the First World War , after the late 1960s , interceptors became less important due to shifting from bombers to intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) for nuclear warfare .
where did the vietnamese settle in america
A Vietnamese American ( ) is an American of Vietnamese descent .
They make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese ( Người Việt Hải Ngoại ) and are the fourth-largest Asian American group .
Mass Vietnamese immigration to the United States started after 1975 , after the end of the Vietnam War .
Early immigrants were refugee boat people fleeing persecution or poverty .
Forced to flee from their homeland and often thrust into poor urban neighborhoods , these newcomers have nevertheless managed to establish strong communities in a short amount of time .
More than sixty percent of Vietnamese Americans reside in the states of California , Texas , Washington , Florida , and Virginia .
when did hitler kill himself
Front page of the U.S. Armed Forces newspaper , Stars and Stripes , 2 May 1945
Adolf Hitler committed suicide by gunshot on 30 April 1945 in his Führerbunker in Berlin .
His wife Eva ( née Braun ) committed suicide with him by ingesting cyanide .
That afternoon , in accordance with Hitler 's prior instructions , their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker 's emergency exit , doused in petrol and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker .
The Soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed , cremated and the ashes scattered .
Accounts differ as to the cause of death ; one that he died by poison only and another that he died by a self-inflicted gunshot , while biting down on a cyanide capsule .
Contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions .
One eye-witness recorded that the body showed signs of having been shot through the mouth , but this has been proven unlikely .
There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments which were recovered .
In 2009 , DNA tests were performed on a skull Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler 's .
The tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old .
when can st louis buy alcohol
Location of Missouri
The alcohol laws of Missouri are among the least restrictive and most lax and permissive in the United States .
Missouri is known throughout the Midwest for its largely laissez-faire approach to alcohol regulation , in sharp contrast to the very strict alcohol laws of some of its neighbors , like Kansas and Oklahoma .
where do flesh eating bacteria live
Necrotizing fasciitis ( or ) or NF , commonly known as flesh-eating disease or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome , is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues , easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue .
Necrotizing fasciitis is quickly progressing , having greater risk of developing in the immunocompromised due to conditions like diabetes , cancer , etc .
It is a severe disease of sudden onset and is usually treated immediately with high doses of intravenous antibiotics .
Type I describes a polymicrobial infection , whereas Type II describes a monomicrobial infection .
Many types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis ( e.g. , Group A streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) , Staphylococcus aureus , Clostridium perfringens , Bacteroides fragilis , Aeromonas hydrophila ) .
Such infections are more likely to occur in people with compromised immune systems .
Historically , Group A streptococcus made up most cases of Type II infections .
However , since as early as 2001 , another serious form of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis has been observed with increasing frequency , caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) .
Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NF , though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a small number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause per se .
when did world war 2 end
World War II ( WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 .
It involved the vast majority of the world 's nations —including all of the great powers —eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis .
It was the most widespread war in history , with more than 100 million people serving in military units from over 30 different countries .
In a state of `` total war `` , the major participants placed their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources .
Marked by mass deaths of civilians , including the Holocaust and the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare , it resulted in 50 million to over 75 million fatalities .
These deaths make World War II by far the deadliest conflict in human history .
The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937 , but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and Britain .
From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany formed the Axis alliance with Italy , conquering or subduing much of continental Europe .
Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories between themselves of their European neighbours , including Poland .
The United Kingdom and the other members of the British Commonwealth were the only major Allied forces continuing the fight against the Axis , with battles taking place in North Africa as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic .
In June 1941 , the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , giving a start to the largest land theatre of war in history , which tied down the major part of the Axis ' military forces for the rest of the war .
In December 1941 , Japan joined the Axis , attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean , and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific .
The Axis advance was stopped in 1942 , after Japan lost a series of naval battles and European Axis troops were defeated in North Africa and , decisively , at Stalingrad .
In 1943 , with a series of German defeats in Eastern Europe , the Allied invasion of Italy , and American victories in the Pacific , the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts .
In 1944 , the Western Allies invaded France , while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies .
During 1944 and 1945 the United States defeated the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands .
The war in Europe ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 .
Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 , the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August , and Nagasaki on 9 August .
With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent , and the Soviet Union having declared war on Japan by invading Manchuria , Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 , ending the war in Asia and cementing the total victory of the Allies over the Axis .
World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world .
The United Nations ( UN ) was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts .
The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States , the Soviet Union , China , the United Kingdom , and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council .
The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers , setting the stage for the Cold War , which lasted for the next 46 years .
Meanwhile , the influence of European great powers started to decline , while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began .
Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery .
Political integration , especially in Europe , emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations and fight more effectively in the Cold War .

what are k cups
Five K-Cups
The inside of a used K-Cup , with the top foil and the used coffee grounds removed .
This shows the filter inside the K-Cup .
K-Cup portion packs are used with Keurig or other single cup brewing systems to brew a cup of coffee , tea , or hot chocolate .
Each K-Cup is a plastic container with a coffee filter inside .
Ground coffee beans are packed in the K-Cup and sealed air-tight with a combination plastic and foil lid .
When the K-Cup is placed in a Keurig brewer , the brewer punctures the foil lid and the bottom of the K-Cup and forces hot water under pressure through the K-Cup and into a mug .
Keurig licenses its K-Cup technology to coffee roasters and tea makers such as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters , Diedrich/ Gloria Jeans , Timothy 's World Coffee , Van Houtte , Caribou Coffee , Celestial Seasonings , Bigelow Tea Company , Twinings , Tully 's , Coffee People and Newman 's Own .
Keurig 's patents on the original K-Cup design expired in September 2012 .
Keurig holds at least one additional , still-active US patent and another patent application , detailing improvements that have subsequently been incorporated in their K-Cup design .

what is a PCI port used for
Conventional PCI ( PCI is an initialism formed from Peripheral Component Interconnect , part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI ) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer .
The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus , but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor .
Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus , and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space .
Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself , called a planar device in the PCI specification , or an expansion card that fits into a slot .
The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles , where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration .
It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types .
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express , but , most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots , which are sufficient for many uses .
The PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus ( including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ) , electrical characteristics , bus timing , and protocols .
The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group ( PCI-SIG ) .
Typical PCI cards used in PCs include : network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as USB or serial , TV tuner cards and disk controllers .
PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards , until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred interface for video cards became AGP , and then PCI Express .
PCI video cards remain available for use with old PCs without AGP or PCI Express slots .
Many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions .

what origin is the name sabotage
An American poster from the World War II -era that was used to inform people about what they should do if they suspect sabotage .
Sabotage is a deliberate action aimed at weakening another entity through subversion , obstruction , disruption , or destruction .
In a workplace setting , sabotage is the conscious withdrawal of efficiency generally directed at causing some change in workplace conditions .
One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur .
As a rule , saboteurs try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions .
For example , whereas an environmental pressure group might be happy to be identified with an act of sabotage , it would not want the individual identities of the perpetrators known .

who invented the television
The history of television comprises the work of numerous engineers and inventors in several countries over many decades .
The earliest proposal was in 1908 , in a paper by A . A. Campbell-Swinton and postulated the use of cathode rays .
The first practical demonstrations of television , however , were developed using electromechanical methods to scan , transmit , and reproduce an image .
As electronic camera and display tubes were perfected , electromechanical television gave way to all-electronic systems in nearly all applications .

what are the side effects for lyme disease
Lyme disease , Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by at least three species of bacteria belonging to the genus Borrelia .
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is the main cause of Lyme disease in North America , whereas Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii cause most European cases .
The disease is named after the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme , Connecticut , USA , where a number of cases were identified in 1975 .
Although Allen Steere realized that Lyme disease was a tick-borne disease in 1978 , the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1981 , when B. burgdorferi was identified by Willy Burgdorfer .
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere .
Borrelia is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks belonging to a few species of the genus Ixodes ( `` hard ticks '' ) .
Early symptoms may include fever , headache , fatigue , depression , and a characteristic circular skin rash called erythema migrans ( EM ) .
Left untreated , later symptoms may involve the joints , heart , and central nervous system .
In most cases , the infection and its symptoms are eliminated by antibiotics , especially if the illness is treated early .
Delayed or inadequate treatment can lead to more serious symptoms , which can be disabling and difficult to treat .
what are penises made out of
Penises of minke whales on display at the Icelandic Phallological Museum
Penis ( plural penises or penes ) is a general term for the organs with which male and hermaphrodite animals introduce sperm into receptive females during copulation .
Such organs occur in many animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , but males do not bear a penis in every animal species , and in those species in which the male does bear a so-called penis , the penes in the various species are not necessarily homologous .
For example , the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle .
The term penis applies to many reproductive intromittent organs , but not to all ; for example the intromittent organ of most cephalopoda is the hectocotylus , a specialised arm , and male spiders use their pedipalps .
In most species of animals in which there is an organ that might reasonably be described as a penis , it has no major function other than intromission , or at least conveying the sperm to the female , but in the placental mammals the penis bears the distal part of the urethra , which discharges both urine during urination and semen during copulation as the occasion requires .
what are a and r reps
Artists and repertoire ( A & R ) is the division of a record label or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of recording artists and/or songwriters .
It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company ; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview of , and responsibility of , A & R .
what measurement is a furlong
A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial units and U.S. customary units equal to one-eighth of a mile , equivalent to 220 yards , 660 feet , 40 rods , or 10 chains .
The exact value of the furlong varies slightly among English-speaking countries .
Five furlongs are approximately 1 kilometre ( 1.0058 km is a closer approximation ) .
Since the original definition of the metre was one-quarter of one ten-millionth of the circumference of the Earth ( along the great circle coincident with the meridian of longitude passing through Paris ) , the circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 km or about 200,000 furlongs .
what is a high energy lithium battery

who made facebook
Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010
Facebook is an online social networking service , whose name stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other .
It was founded in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin , Andrew McCollum , Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes .
The website 's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students , but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area , the Ivy League , and Stanford University .
It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students , and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over .
Facebook now allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site .
Users must register before using the site , after which they may create a personal profile , add other users as friends , and exchange messages , including automatic notifications when they update their profile .
Additionally , users may join common-interest user groups , organized by workplace , school or college , or other characteristics , and categorize their friends into lists such as `` People From Work '' or `` Close Friends '' .
As of September 2012 , Facebook has over one billion active users .
According to a May 2011 Consumer Reports survey , there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts and 5 million under 10 , violating the site 's terms of service .
In May 2005 , Accel partners invested $ 12.7 million in Facebook , and Jim Breyer added $ 1 million of his own money to the pot .
A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users .
Entertainment Weekly included the site on its end-of-the-decade `` best-of '' list , saying , `` How on earth did we stalk our exes , remember our co-workers ' birthdays , bug our friends , and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook ? ''
Critics , such as Facebook Detox , state that Facebook has turned into a national obsession in the United States , resulting in vast amounts of time lost and encouraging narcissism .
Quantcast estimates Facebook has 138.9 million monthly unique U.S. visitors in May 2011 .
According to Social Media Today , in April 2010 an estimated 41.6 % ( 129.5 million ) of the U.S. population had a Facebook account .
Nevertheless , Facebook 's market growth started to stall in some regions , with the site losing 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011 .
Facebook eventually filed for an initial public offering on February 1 , 2012 , and was headquartered in Menlo Park , California .
Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ on May 18 , 2012 .
where did the british defeat of Rommel
Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel ( 15 November 1891 – 14 October 1944 ) , popularly known as The Desert Fox ( Wüstenfuchs , ) , was a German Field Marshal of World War II .
He earned the respect of both his own troops and the enemies he fought .
Rommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the Pour le Mérite for his exploits on the Italian front .
In World War II , he further distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France .
His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established him as one of the most able commanders of the war , and earned him the appellation of the Desert Fox .
He is regarded as one of the most skilled commanders of desert warfare in the conflict .
He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion in Normandy .
His assignments never took him to the Eastern Front .
Rommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer .
His Afrika Korps was never accused of war crimes , and soldiers captured during his Africa campaign were reported to have been treated humanely .
Orders to kill Jewish soldiers , civilians and captured commandos were ignored .
Late in the war , Rommel was linked to the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler .
Since Rommel was a national hero , Hitler desired to eliminate him quietly .
He forced Rommel to commit suicide with a cyanide pill , in return for assurances that Rommel 's family would not be persecuted following his death .

who created earth day
The Earth Day Flag , the latest proposal of John McConnell for a flag of Earth Day
Earth Day is an annual event , celebrated on April 22 , on which events are held worldwide to demonstrate support for environmental protection .
It was first celebrated in 1970 , and is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network , and celebrated in more than 192 countries each year .
In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco , the date proposed was March 21 , 1970 , the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere .
This day of nature 's equipoise was later sanctioned in a Proclamation signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations .
A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22 , 1970 .
Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award in recognition of his work .
While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States , an organization launched by Denis Hayes , who was the original national coordinator in 1970 , took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations .
Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week , an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues .
where do you find iodine
Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53 .
The name is from Greek ioeidēs , meaning violet or purple , due to the color of elemental iodine vapor .
Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition , and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers .
Iodine 's relatively high atomic number , low toxicity , and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine .
Iodine has only one stable isotope .
A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications .
Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion , I− , which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools .
Like the other halogens , free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2 , and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen .
In the universe and on Earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element .
However , its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology .
It is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions ( only tungsten , employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria , is heavier ) .
Iodine 's rarity in many soils , due to initial low abundance as a crust-element , and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater , has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations .
Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities .
Iodine is required by higher animals , which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones , which contain the element .
Because of this function , radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine .
If inhaled , the radioisotope iodine-131 , which has a high fission product yield , concentrates in the thyroid , but is easily remedied with potassium iodide treatment .
what are lobbying groups
Lobbying ( also lobby ) is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government , most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies .
Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups , including individuals in the private sector , corporations , fellow legislators or government officials , or advocacy groups ( interest groups ) .
Lobbyists may be among a legislator 's constituencies , meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district , or not ; they may engage in lobbying as a business , or not .
Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them .
Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job ( for instance , a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to his/her company , or an activist meeting with his/her legislator in an unpaid capacity ) .
Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential .
The ethics and morality of lobbying are .
Lobbying is often spoken of with contempt , when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law ( twisting it away from fairness ) in order to serve their own conflict of interest .
But another side of lobbying is making sure that others ' interests are duly defended against others ' corruption , or even simply making sure that minority interests are fairly defended against mere tyranny of the majority .
For example , a medical association , or a trade association of health insurance companies , may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies , in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified ( duly defending against others ' corruption ) .
The difficulty in drawing objective lines between which lobbyists are `` good lobbyists '' and which ones are `` bad ones '' is compounded by the cleverness with which lobbyists or their clients can argue that their own lobbying is of the `` good '' kind .
At heart , the effort to influence legislation is a power struggle .
As in other forms of power struggle , such as war or law enforcement , motives range from to self-defense to fighting for justice , and the dividing line between predation and justice is subject to rationalization .
who played the drums in the band cream back in 1968
Sunshine of your love guitar riff
Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup consisting of bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce , guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton , and drummer Ginger Baker .
Their sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues rock , hard rock and psychedelic rock , combining the psychedelia-themed lyrics , Eric Clapton 's blues guitar playing and vocals , Jack Bruce 's voice and prominent bass playing and Ginger Baker 's jazz -influenced drumming .
The group 's third album , Wheels of Fire , was the world 's first platinum-selling double album .
Cream are widely regarded as being the world 's first successful supergroup .
In their career , they sold over 15 million albums worldwide .
Cream 's music included songs based on traditional blues such as `` Crossroads `` and `` Spoonful `` , and modern blues such as `` Born Under a Bad Sign `` , as well as more eccentric songs such as `` Strange Brew `` , `` Tales of Brave Ulysses `` and `` Toad `` .
Cream 's biggest hits were `` I Feel Free `` ( UK , number 11 ) , `` Sunshine of Your Love `` ( US , number 5 ) , `` White Room `` ( US , number 6 ) , `` Crossroads '' ( US , number 28 ) , and `` Badge `` ( UK , number 18 ) .
Cream made a significant impact on the popular music of the time , and , along with Jimi Hendrix , and Terry Kath of Chicago , popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal .
They provided a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s .
The band 's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush .
Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 .
They were included in both Rolling Stone and VH1 's lists of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' .
They were also ranked number 16 on VH1 's `` 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock '' .
Who played the role of Tracy Turnblad in the original 1988 version of the movie `` Hairspray '' ?
Hairspray is a 1988 comedy film written and directed by John Waters , and starring Ricki Lake , Sonny Bono , Debbie Harry , Michael St. Gerard , Shawn Thompson , Colleen Fitzpatrick , Jerry Stiller , and in his last film role , Divine .
Hairspray was a dramatic departure from Waters ' earlier works , with a much broader intended audience .
In fact , Hairsprays PG is the mildest rating a Waters film has received ; most of his previous films were rated X by the MPAA .
Set in 1962 Baltimore , Maryland , the film revolves around self-proclaimed `` pleasantly plump '' teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against racial segregation .
Hairspray was only a moderate success upon its initial theatrical release , earning a modest gross of $ 8 million .
However , it managed to attract a larger audience on home video in the early 1990s and became a cult classic .
Most critics praised the film , although some were displeased with the overall campiness .
In 2002 , the film was adapted into a Broadway musical of the same name , which won eight Tony Awards , including Best Musical in 2003 .
A second film version of Hairspray , an adaptation of the stage musical , was also released by New Line Cinema in 2007 , which included many changes of scripted items from the original .
The film also ranks # 444 on Empire magazine 's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time .
what religions are considered christian
A Christian denomination is an identifiable religious body under a common name , structure , and doctrine within Christianity .
Some groups included do not consider themselves a denomination ( e.g. , the Catholic Church considers itself the one true church and the Apostolic See , and as pre-denominational ) .
Some groups viewed by non-adherents as denominational actively resist being called a denomination and do not have any formal denominational structure , authority , or record-keeping beyond the local congregation ; several groups within Restoration Movement fall into this category .
Some groups are large ( e.g . Catholics , Lutherans , Anglicans or Baptists ) , while others are just a few small churches , and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list .
Modern movements such as Fundamentalist Christianity , Pietism , Evangelicalism , Pentecostalism and the Holiness movement sometimes cross denominational lines , or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups , ( as is the case for many United and uniting churches , for example ) .
Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here .
Major divisions within Christianity .
Note : This is not a complete list , but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity .
As there are reported to be approximately 41,000 Christian denominations , many of which can not be verified to be significant , only those denominations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable .
Between denominations , theologians , and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian , disagreements arising primarily from doctrinal differences between groups .
For the purpose of simplicity , this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination .
Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles .
There is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies , and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies .
Often there is considerable disagreement between various churches about whether other churches should be labeled with pejorative terms such as `` cult '' , or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability .
Such considerations often vary from place to place , where one religious group may enjoy majority status in one region , but be widely regarded as a `` dangerous cult '' in another part of the world .
Inclusion on this list does not indicate any judgment about the size , importance , or character of a group or its members .
what president made decision to buy louisiana
1804 map of `` Louisiana `` , edged on the west by the Rocky Mountains .
The Louisiana Purchase ( `` Sale of Louisiana '' ) was the acquisition by the United States of America in 1803 of of France 's claim to the territory of Louisiana .
The U.S. paid 50 million francs ( $ 11 ,250,000 ) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ( $ 3,750,000 ) , for a total sum of 15 million dollars ( less than 3 cents per acre ) for the Louisiana territory ( $ million in dollars , less than 42 cents per acre ) .
The Louisiana territory encompassed all or part of 15 present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces .
The land purchased contained all of present-day Arkansas , Missouri , Iowa , Oklahoma , Kansas , and Nebraska ; parts of Minnesota that were west of the Mississippi River ; most of North Dakota ; most of South Dakota ; northeastern New Mexico ; northern Texas ; the portions of Montana , Wyoming , and Colorado east of the Continental Divide ; Louisiana west of the Mississippi River , including the city of New Orleans ; and small portions of land that would eventually become part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan .
France controlled this vast area from 1699 until 1762 , the year it gave the territory to its ally Spain .
Under Napoleon Bonaparte , France took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in North America .
A slave revolt in Haiti and an impending war with Britain , however , led France to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the United States , who had originally intended only to seek the purchase of New Orleans and its adjacent lands .
The purchase of the territory of Louisiana took place during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson .
At the time , the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional .
Although he agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory , Jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove France 's presence in the region and to protect both U.S. trade access to the port of New Orleans and free passage on the Mississippi River .

who sang cool jerk
`` Cool Jerk '' is a popular song written by Donald Storball and originally performed by The Capitols .
Released in 1966 , it reached No . 2 on the American R & B chart and No . 7 on the pop chart .
The backing track for this song was actually recorded ( secretly ) by the Motown house band The Funk Brothers .
Per one of the Funk Brothers , the song was originally to be called `` Pimp Jerk . ''
This was taken from watching neighborhood pimps , who would dance in the clubs , but were too `` cool '' to do the jerk like regular folks .
Their version was subsequently named `` the Pimp Jerk . ''
The producer was afraid that a song with the word pimp in the title would be banned or not receive much positive attention , and had the title changed to its current form .
The Go-Go 's , Todd Rundgren , Big Trouble , Human Sexual Response , The La De Da 's , The Creation , and The Coasters have covered the song .
Todd Rundgren did his version in an odd time signature ( 7/4 ) , giving an obviously jerky feel to the song .
The Go-Go 's covered the song for their 1982 album Vacation and later re-recorded it for their 1990 album Greatest .
In the feature film Home Alone 2 : Lost in New York , Uncle Frank ( Gerry Bamman ) sings `` Cool Jerk '' in the shower .
A version of the song with different lyrics ( `` Do the Cool Whip '' ) is used in Cool Whip commercials .
A recording of `` Cool Jerk '' by Ricardo Ray is featured in the feature film Donnie Brasco ( 1997 ) .
The song features in the film Standing in the Shadows of Motown , performed by the Funk Brothers with lead vocals by Bootsy Collins .
The song is heard briefly in the animated feature , Madagascar 3 : Europe 's Most Wanted .
Despite this reason , it is listed in some variations of the film 's soundtrack .
what is a league in the sea
A league is a unit of length ( or , rarely , area ) .
It was long common in Europe and Latin America , but it is no longer an official unit in any nation .
The league originally referred to the distance a person could walk in an hour .
Since the Middle Ages , many values have been specified in several countries .
In the context of nautical distances , the 3 mile ( 4.8 km ) distance corresponds to how far an observer of average height ( 5'9 '' or 1.78 m ) can see when standing at sea level .
Thus , a ship traveling one `` league '' has reached what was previously the farthest visible distance on the horizon .
The lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a `` league '' can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer ( i.e. , sightings from a ship 's deck vs. masthead ) .
when did ireland become republic
The Irish state came into being in 1922 as the Irish Free State , a dominion of the British Commonwealth , having seceded from the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Treaty .
It comprises 26 of Ireland 's 32 counties .
Since 1949 it has existed as the Republic of Ireland .
From its foundation , the Irish Free State was embroiled in a civil war between nationalists supporting the Treaty and opponents who supported a republic .
The pro-Treaty side , organised as Cumann na nGaedheal emerged victorious from the conflict and won subsequent elections .
They formed the government of the state until 1932 , when they peacefully handed over power to the anti-Treaty faction in Fianna Fáil , who defeated them in an election .
The Irish state , despite its violent beginnings , has remained a liberal democracy throughout its existence .
A new constitution in 1937 removed many of the links with Britain established under the Treaty and Ireland 's neutrality in the Second World War demonstrated its independence in foreign policy matters from Britain .
In 1948 Ireland formally left the British Commonwealth and adopted the title of `` Republic '' .
In the economic sphere , the Irish state has had a mixed performance .
On independence , it was one of the wealthier countries in Europe per head of population .
However it also inherited from British rule the problems of unemployment , emigration , uneven geographical development and lack of a native industrial base .
For much of its history , the state struggled to rectify these problems .
Particular peaks of emigration were recorded during the late 1930s , 1950s and 1980s , when the Irish economy recorded little growth .
In the 1930s , Fianna Fáil governments attempted to create Irish domestic industries using subsidies and protective tarifs .
In the late 1950s , these policies were dropped in favour of free trade with selected countries and encouraging of foreign investment with low taxes .
This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1972 .
In the 1990s and 2000s , Ireland experienced an economic boom known as the Celtic Tiger , in which the country 's GDP surpassed many of its European neighbours .
Immigration also surpassed emigration , bringing the state 's population up to over 4 million .
However , since 2008 , Ireland has experienced a severe crisis in the banking sector and with sovereign debt .
The resultant economic slump has deepened the effect of the world recession on Ireland .
From 1937 to 1998 , the Irish constitution included a claim on Northern Ireland as a part of the national territory .
However , the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups - principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army , who tried to unite Ireland by force .
This occurred in the 1950s , throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale .
Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as The Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s .
The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 .
In 1998 , as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they wish to have it .
what negative element was introduced into the the campaign between andrew jackson and john ouincy adams
John Quincy Adams ( July 11 , 1767February 23 , 1848 ) was the sixth President of the United States ( 1825–1829 ) .
He served as American diplomat , Senator , and Congressional representative .
He was a member of the Federalist , Democratic-Republican , National Republican , and later Anti-Masonic and Whig parties .
Adams was the son of former President John Adams and Abigail Adams .
As a diplomat , Adams played an important role in negotiating many international treaties , most notably the Treaty of Ghent , which ended the War of 1812 .
As Secretary of State , he negotiated with the United Kingdom over America 's northern border with Canada , negotiated with Spain the annexation of Florida , and authored the Monroe Doctrine .
Historians agree he was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history .
As president , he sought to modernize the American economy and promoted education .
Adams enacted a part of his agenda and paid off much of the national debt .
He was stymied by a Congress controlled by his enemies , and his lack of patronage networks helped politicians eager to undercut him .
He lost his 1828 bid for re-election to Andrew Jackson .
In doing so , he became the first president since his father to serve a single term .
Adams is best known as a diplomat who shaped America 's foreign policy in line with his ardently nationalist commitment to America 's republican values .
More recently Howe ( 2007 ) portrayed Adams as the exemplar and moral leader in an era of modernization .
During Adams ' lifetime , technological innovations and new means of communication spread messages of religious revival , social reform , and party politics .
Goods , money , and people traveled more rapidly and efficiently than ever before .
Adams was elected a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts after leaving office , serving for the last 17 years of his life with far greater acclamation than he had achieved as president .
He is , so far , the only president later elected to the United States House of Representatives ( though John Tyler was elected to the House of Representatives of the Confederate States just before his death in 1862 ) .
Animated by his growing revulsion against slavery , Adams became a leading opponent of the Slave Power .
He predicted that if a civil war were to break out , the president could abolish slavery by using his war powers .
Adams also predicted the Union 's dissolution over the slavery issue , but said that if the South became independent there would be a series of bloody slave revolts .

what are the acronyms for masters degree
Degree abbreviations are used as an alternative way to specify an academic degree instead of spelling out the title in full , such as in reference books like Who 's Who and on business cards .
Many degrees have more than one abbreviation .
In the UK , it is not generally the custom to punctuate abbreviations for degrees with full stops ( e.g . `` BSc '' rather than `` B.Sc . `` .
when did classification of races begin
Race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , or social affiliation .
First used to denote national affiliations , the term began to be used to relate to physical traits in the 17th century .
In the early 20th century the term was often used , in a taxonomic sense , to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype .
While biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits , others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way , i.e . that among humans , race has no taxonomic significance : all living humans belong to the same species , Homo sapiens and subspecies , Homo sapiens sapiens .
Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time , involving folk taxonomies
that define of individuals based on perceived traits .
Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete , and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits .
Since the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic .
Although still used in general contexts , it is now often replaced by other words which are less ambiguous and emotionally charged , such as populations , people ( s ) , ethnic groups or communities depending on context .
when did lucy stone died
Lucy Stone ( August 13 , 1818 – October 19 , 1893 ) was a prominent American abolitionist and suffragist , and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women .
In 1847 , Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree .
She spoke out for women 's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking .
Stone was the first recorded American woman to retain her own last name after marriage .
Stone 's organizational activities for the cause of women 's rights yielded tangible gains in the difficult political environment of the 19th century .
Stone helped initiate the first National Women 's Rights Convention and she supported and sustained it annually along with a number of other local , state and regional activist conventions .
Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women .
She assisted in establishing the Woman 's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery , after which she helped form the largest group of like-minded women 's rights reformers , the politically moderate American Woman Suffrage Association , which worked for decades at the state level in favor of women 's right to vote .
Stone wrote extensively about a wide range of women 's rights , publishing and distributing speeches by herself and others , and convention proceedings .
In the long-running and influential Woman 's Journal , a weekly periodical that she established and promoted , Stone aired both her own and differing views about women 's rights .
Called `` the orator '' and `` the morning star of the woman 's rights movement '' , Stone delivered a speech which sparked Susan B. Anthony to take up the cause of women 's suffrage .
Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that `` Lucy Stone was the first person by whom the heart of the American public was deeply stirred on the woman question . ''
Together , Anthony , Stanton , and Stone have been called the 19th century `` triumvirate `` of women 's suffrage and feminism .
what are stocks and bonds
In finance , a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders .
It is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and , depending on the terms of the bond , is obliged to pay them interest ( the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later date , termed the maturity .
Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals ( semiannual , annual , sometimes monthly ) .
Very often the bond is negotiable , i.e . the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market .
Thus a bond is a form of loan or IOU : the holder of the bond is the lender ( creditor ) , the issuer of the bond is the borrower ( debtor ) , and the coupon is the interest .
Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments , or , in the case of government bonds , to finance current expenditure .
Certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or short term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds : the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument .
Bonds and stocks are both securities , but the major difference between the two is that ( capital ) stockholders have an equity stake in the company ( i.e . they are owners ) , whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company ( i.e . they are lenders ) .
Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term , or maturity , after which the bond is redeemed , whereas stocks may be outstanding indefinitely .
An exception is an irredeemable bond , such as Consols , which is a perpetuity , i.e . a bond with no maturity .

A scale model is a physical model , a representation or copy of an object that is larger or smaller than the actual size of the object , which seeks to maintain the relative proportions ( the scale factor ) of the physical size of the original object .
Very often the scale model is used as a guide to making the object in full size .
Scale models are built or collected for many reasons .

what states has the electric chair
Old Sparky , the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison
Execution by electrocution , usually performed using an electric chair , is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body .
This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and , for a period of several decades , in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976 ) .
Historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ) .
The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs .
Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .
Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution .
Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner .
As of 2010 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia .
They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method .
In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 ( Kentucky : March 31 , 1998 ; Tennessee : December 31 , 1998 ) and who chose electrocution .
In both states , inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection .
The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution .
It is the sole method of execution in Vermont , where treason is the only capital crime .
On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution .
This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder .

when did germans enter paris in ww2
The Liberation of Paris ( also known as the Battle for Paris ) took place during World War II from 19 August 1944 until the surrender of the occupying German garrison on 25 August .
The Liberation of Paris started with an uprising by the French Resistance against the German garrison .
On 24 August , the French Forces of the Interior ( Forces françaises de l'intérieur , FFI ) received reinforcements from the Free French Army of Liberation and from the U.S. Third Army under General Patton .
The capital region of France had been governed by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Second Compiègne Armistice in June 1940 , when the German Army occupied northern and westernmost France , and when the puppet regime of Vichy France was established in the town of Vichy in central France .
This battle marked the liberation of Paris and the exile of the Vichy government to Sigmaringen in Germany .
However , there was still much heavy fighting to be done before France was liberated , including the campaign in southern France during August-September ( in Provence and extending into the southwestern region of the Vosges Mountains ) , along the German-held seaports of western France ( such as at Brest and Dunkirk ) , in Alsace and Lorraine in eastern France , and in northeastern France , such as along the Rhine and Moder Rivers .
The German Army and SS fought doggedly in these areas for the remainder of 1944 and into 1945 .

When did the New Deal start
Top left : The Tennessee Valley Authority , part of the New Deal , being signed into law in 1933 .
Top right : Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who was responsible for initiatives and programs collectively known as the New Deal .
Bottom : A public mural from one of the artists employed by the New Deal .
The New Deal was a series of economic programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1936 .
They involved presidential executive orders or laws passed by Congress during the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
The programs were in response to the Great Depression , and focused on what historians call the `` 3 Rs '' : Relief , Recovery , and Reform .
That is Relief for the unemployed and poor ; Recovery of the economy to normal levels ; and Reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression .
The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of nine Presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) , with its base in liberal ideas , the white South , traditional Democrats , big city machines , and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities .
The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an enemy of business and growth , and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient .
The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s , while the opposition Conservative Coalition largely controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963 .
By 1936 the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the New Deal , and `` conservative `` for its opponents .
From 1934 to 1938 , Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavours by a “pro-spender” majority in Congress ( drawn from two-party , competitive , non-machine , Progressive , and Left party districts ) .
As noted by Alexander Hicks , “Roosevelt , backed by rare , non-Southern Democrat majorities — 270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators — spelled Second New Deal reform.”
Many historians distinguish between a `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) and a `` Second New Deal '' ( 1935–38 ) , with the second one more liberal and more controversial .
The `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) dealt with diverse groups , from banking and railroads to industry and farming , all of which demanded help for economic survival .
The Federal Emergency Relief Administration , for instance , provided $ 500 million for relief operations by states and cities , while the short-lived CWA ( Civil Works Administration ) gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34 .
The `` Second New Deal `` in 1935–38 included the Wagner Act to promote labor unions , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) relief program ( which made the federal government by far the largest single employer in the nation ) , the Social Security Act , and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers .
The final major items of New Deal legislation were the creation of the United States Housing Authority and Farm Security Administration , both in 1937 , and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 , which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most categories of workers .
The economic downturn of 1937–38 , and the bitter split between the AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938 .
Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition .
By 1942–43 they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and CCC and blocked major liberal proposals .
Roosevelt himself turned his attention to the war effort , and won reelection in 1940 and 1944 .
The Supreme Court declared the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment Act ( AAA ) unconstitutional , however the AAA was rewritten and then upheld .
As the first Republican president elected after FDR , Dwight D. Eisenhower ( 1953–61 ) left the New Deal largely intact , even expanding it in some areas .
In the 1960s , Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs , which Republican Richard M. Nixon generally retained .
After 1974 , however , the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support .
The New Deal regulation of banking ( Glass–Steagall Act ) was suspended in the 1990s .
Many New Deal programs remain active , with some still operating under the original names , including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ( FCIC ) , the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) , and the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) .
The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
where does the word woman comes from
A woman ( ) , pl : women ( ) is a female human .
The term woman is usually reserved for an adult , with the term girl being the usual term for a female child or adolescent .
However , the term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human , regardless of age , as in phrases such as `` Women 's rights `` .
Women are typically capable of giving birth , though older women who have gone through menopause and some intersex women can not .
what year did aerosmith i dont want to miss a thing
`` I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing '' is a song performed by American rock band Aerosmith for the 1998 film Armageddon .

The song stayed at number one for four weeks from September 5 to September 26 , 1998 .
The song also stayed at number 1 for several weeks in several other countries .
In the UK , the song peaked at number four , becoming Aerosmith 's highest charting song in the UK , where it was the 17th best-selling single of 1998 , and has sold over a million copies .
when did daylight savings time start
Although not used by the majority of the world 's countries , daylight saving time is common in the Western world .
Daylight saving time ( DST ) —also summer time in British English — is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less .
Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn .
The modern idea of daylight saving was first proposed in 1895 by George Vernon Hudson and it was first implemented during the First World War .
Many countries have used it at various times since then .
Much of the United States used DST in the 1950s and 1960s , and DST use expanded following the 1970s energy crisis and has been widely used in North America and Europe since then .
The practice has been both praised and criticized .
Adding daylight to evenings benefits retailing , sports , and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours , but can cause problems for evening entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun .
Although an early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting ( formerly a primary use of electricity ) , modern heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly , and research about how DST currently affects energy use is limited or contradictory .
DST clock shifts present other challenges .
They complicate timekeeping , and can disrupt meetings , travel , billing , record keeping , medical devices , heavy equipment , and sleep patterns .
Software can often adjust computer clocks automatically , but this can be limited and error-prone , particularly when DST dates are changed .
What region of France is Montargis in ?
Floorplan of the Château de Montargis
Montargis is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France on the Loing river .
The town is located about south of Paris and east of Orléans in the Gâtinais .
Montargis is the second largest city in the Loiret , after Orléans .
It is near a large forest , and contains light industry and farming , including saffron .
Due to its numerous canals and bridges , Montargis sometimes bills itself as the `` Venice of the Gâtinais . ''
Though quite modern , it retains a medieval charm in its downtown area .
what is a unit numbering system ?
In computer storage , a logical unit number , or LUN , is a number used to identify a logical unit , which is a device addressed by the SCSI protocol or protocols which encapsulate SCSI , such as Fibre Channel or iSCSI .
A LUN may be used with any device which supports read/write operations , such as a tape drive , but is most often used to refer to a logical disk as created on a SAN .
Though not technically correct , the term `` LUN '' is often also used to refer to the logical disk itself .
where in gospel of mark does the disciples question Christ deity
The Gospel According to Mark ( , , to euangelion kata Markon ) , commonly shortened to the Gospel of Mark or simply Mark , is the second book of the New Testament .
This canonical account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth is one of the three synoptic gospels .
It was thought to be an epitome , which accounts for its place as the second gospel in the Bible .
However , most contemporary scholars now regard it as the earliest of the canonical gospels ( c 70 ) .
That Mark was used as a source for the other synoptic gospels Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke is widely held by many , although not all , New Testament scholars .
The Gospel of Mark narrates the Ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death and resurrection .
It focuses particularly on the last week of his life ( chapters 11–16 ) in Jerusalem .
Its swift narrative portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action , an exorcist , healer and miracle worker .
An important theme of Mark is the Messianic Secret .
Jesus silences the demoniacs he heals , tries unsuccessfully to keep his messianic identity secret , and conceals his message with parables .
Meanwhile , the disciples fail to understand both the implication of the miracles of Jesus and the meaning of the things he predicts about his arrest , death and resurrection .
Most scholars believe that the original text of the gospel ends at Mark 16:8 with the discovery of Jesus ' empty tomb and that the following account of his resurrection appearances is a later addition .
According to tradition and some early church writers , the author is Mark the Evangelist , the companion of the apostle Peter .
The gospel , however , appears to rely on several underlying sources , varying in form and in theology , which tells against the tradition that the gospel was based on Peter 's preaching .
The text is a compilation which may include eye-witness accounts as well as known apostolic preachings , and pre-existing written records that do not exist today but can be confirmed from 2nd-century commentators .
Some of the stories in the gospel may have been transmitted orally before being written down .
Various elements within the gospel suggest that the author wrote in Syria or Palestine for a non-Jewish Christian community .
what year lord of rings made ?
The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien .
The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 children 's fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work .
It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , much of it during World War II .
It is the second best-selling novel ever written , with over 150 million copies sold .
The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth .
From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a Hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across north-west Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , notably the hobbits Frodo Baggins , Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee , Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck and Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took , but also the hobbits ' chief allies and travelling companions : Aragorn , a Human Ranger ; Boromir , a man from Gondor ; Gimli , a Dwarf warrior ; Legolas , an Elven prince ; and Gandalf , a Wizard .
The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , with the other being The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher .
It was decided for economic reasons to publish The Lord of the Rings as three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 , thus creating the now familiar Lord of the Rings trilogy .
The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King .
Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume .
The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages .
Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .
Although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia .
Influences on this earlier work , and on the story of The Lord of the Rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien 's experiences in World War I .
The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of Tolkien 's works is such that the use of the words `` Tolkienian '' and `` Tolkienesque '' have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary .
The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works .
The Lord of the Rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature .
Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio , theatre , and film .

when does college football training camp start
The San Francisco 49ers conduct training camp at the team 's headquarters and practice facility in Santa Clara , California in August 2010 .
The offense is wearing red jerseys with the exception of quarterback Alex Smith , who is in a black jersey ; the defense in white .
In the National Football League , training camp refers to the time before the season commences .
During this time , teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location , usually a university , to conduct training camp for at least the first few weeks .
This is similar to baseball 's spring training .
Training camp is used in several different ways .
New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems .
For younger players , it serves as a period of evaluation ; for veterans , it is time to round back into form .
Training camp is divided into several different components .
The first is scrimmages .
These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games ' worth of plays .
Sometimes , two practice sessions are held on the same day .
This concept is referred to as two-a-days .
Other parts of training camp include drills , meetings with coaches and other players at one 's position , weight training , and pre-season games .
The latter half of training camp leads directly into the exhibition season .
With NFL training camps starting in late-July , the biggest concern has been dehydration .
In 2001 , Minnesota Vikings player Korey Stringer died of a medical condition based from dehydration and heatstroke .
The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies .
At each practice , every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field ; additionally , an ambulance must be present during practices .
With NFL training camps beginning in late July , severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games .
In 2002 , a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near Cleveland Browns Stadium , and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps .
Fans are often able to visit their favorite team 's training camp to catch an early look at the players ; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket , making training camp trips a popular option for fans who can not attend many games due to financial or other reasons .
NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience .
what is file based system
In computing , a file system ( or filesystem ) is a type of data store which can be used to store , retrieve and update a set of files .
The term could refer to the abstract data structures used to define files , or to the actual software or firmware components that implement the abstract ideas .
Some file systems are used on local data storage devices ; others provide file access via a network protocol ( e.g . NFS , SMB , or 9P clients ) .
Some file systems are `` virtual '' , in that the `` files '' supplied are computed on request ( e.g . procfs ) or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store .
The file system manages access to both the content of files and the metadata about those files .
It is responsible for arranging storage space ; reliability , efficiency , and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations .
What political conflicts marked the presidency of William Howard Taft ?
William Howard Taft ( September 15 , 1857 – March 8 , 1930 ) was the 27th President of the United States ( 1909–1913 ) and later the tenth Chief Justice of the United States ( 1921–1930 ) .
He is the only person to have served in both of these offices .
Before becoming President , Taft , a Republican , was selected to serve on the Superior Court of Cincinnati in 1887 .
In 1890 , Taft was appointed Solicitor General of the United States and in 1891 a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit .
In 1900 , President William McKinley appointed Taft Governor-General of the Philippines .
In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Taft Secretary of War in an effort to groom Taft , then his close political ally , into his handpicked presidential successor .
Taft assumed a prominent role in problem solving , assuming on some occasions the role of acting Secretary of State , while declining repeated offers from Roosevelt to serve on the Supreme Court .
Riding a wave of popular support for fellow Republican Roosevelt , Taft won an easy victory in his 1908 bid for the presidency .
In his only term , Taft 's domestic agenda emphasized trust-busting , civil service reform , strengthening the Interstate Commerce Commission , improving the performance of the postal service , and passage of the Sixteenth Amendment .
Abroad , Taft sought to further the economic development of nations in Latin America and Asia through `` Dollar Diplomacy `` , and showed decisiveness and restraint in response to revolution in Mexico .
The task-oriented Taft was oblivious to the political ramifications of his decisions , often alienated his own key constituencies , and was overwhelmingly defeated in his bid for a second term in the presidential election of 1912 .
In surveys of presidential scholars , Taft is usually ranked near the middle of lists of all American Presidents .
After leaving office , Taft spent his time in academia , arbitration , and the search for world peace through his self-founded League to Enforce Peace .
In 1921 , after the First World War , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft Chief Justice of the United States .
Taft served in this capacity until shortly before his death in 1930 .
What role did clint walker play in the movie The Ten Commandments
The Ten Commandments is a 1956 epic film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille that dramatized the biblical story of the Exodus , in which the Hebrew-born Moses , an adopted Egyptian prince , becomes the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves .
It starred Charlton Heston in the lead role , Yul Brynner as his adoptive brother , Pharaoh Rameses II , Anne Baxter as Nefretiri , Edward G. Robinson as Dathan , Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora , Debra Paget as Lilia , and John Derek as Joshua .
The supporting cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti I , Nina Foch as Bithiah , Martha Scott as Yoshebel , Judith Anderson as Memnet , Vincent Price as Baka , and John Carradine as Aaron .
The film was released by Paramount Pictures in VistaVision on October 5 , 1956 .
The Ten Commandments , which DeMille narrated , was the last film that he directed .
He was set to direct the 1958 remake of his 1938 film The Buccaneer , but his final illness forced him to relinquish the directing chores to his son-in-law , actor Anthony Quinn .
DeMille had also planned to film the life of Lord Baden Powell , the founder of the Scout movement , with David Niven ; this project was never realized .
The Ten Commandments is a partial remake of DeMille 's 1923 silent film .
Some of the cast and crew of the 1956 version worked on the original .
It has since been remade as a television miniseries broadcast in April 2006 .
The Ten Commandments is one of the most financially successful films ever made , grossing over $ 65 million at the U.S. box office .
Adjusting for inflation , this makes it the sixth highest-grossing film domestically , with an adjusted total of $ 1,025,730,000 in 2012 .
The box office website `` The Numbers '' lists the domestic gross at $ 80 million .
In 1999 , The Ten Commandments was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .
In June 2008 , the American Film Institute revealed its `` Ten Top Ten `` —the best ten films in ten American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community .
The Ten Commandments was listed as the tenth best film in the epic genre .
The film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture , and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects .
Charlton Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor in the drama category .
Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his role as Rameses , along with his other roles in The King and I and Anastasia .
where does louisville rank with broadway shows
Louisville ( , or ) is a major city and the largest city in the U.S. state of Kentucky and the county seat of Jefferson County .
Since 2003 , the city 's borders have been with those of the county because of a city-county merger .
The city 's total consolidated population at the 2010 census was 741,096 ( Louisville 's balance total , 602,011 , excludes semi-autonomous towns and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings ) .
As of 2010 , the Louisville metropolitan area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,307,647 ranking 42nd nationally .
The metro area includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 surrounding counties , eight in Kentucky and four in Southern Indiana ( see Geography below ) .
The Louisville Combined Statistical Area , having a population of 1,451,564 , includes the MSA , Hardin County and Larue County in Kentucky , and Scott County , Indiana .
An important internal shipping port in the 19th century , Louisville today is best known as the location of the Kentucky Derby , the first of three annual thoroughbred horse races making up the Triple Crown .
what temperature is a salt ice bath
A typical experimental setup for an aldol reaction .
Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath ( −78 °C ) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple ( the wire on the left ) .
A cooling bath , in laboratory chemistry ( often but not always organic chemistry ) practice , is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures , typically between 13 °C and −196 °C .
These low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation , to remove solvents using a rotary evaporator , or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature ( see : kinetic control ) .
Cooling baths are generally one of two types : ( a ) a cold fluid ( particularly liquid nitrogen , water , or even air ) — but most commonly the term refers to ( b ) a mixture of 3 components : ( 1 ) a cooling agent ( such as dry ice or water ice ) ; ( b ) a liquid 'carrier ' ( such as liquid water , ethylene glycol , acetone , etc . ) , which transfers heat between the bath and the vessel ; ; and ( c ) an additive to depress the melting-point of the solid/liquid system .
( A familiar example of this is the use of an ice/rock-salt mixture to freeze ice cream .
The phase-change of ice into liquid water requires energy , 'pulling ' heat from the system .
Adding salt lowers the temp at which this happens , meaning more energy has to be absorbed from the environment in order to melt the ice .
This effectively makes the ice 'colder ' — it must 'pull ' more heat from its environment to become liquid . )
what not to say to eating disorder
Eating disorders are conditions defined by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive food intake to the detriment of an individual 's physical and mental health .
Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most common specific forms in the United Kingdom .
Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified .
Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging .
Purging can include self-induce vomiting , over-exercising , and the usage of diuretics , enemas , and laxatives .
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss .
Though primarily thought of as affecting females ( an estimated 5–10 million being affected in the U.K. ) , eating disorders affect males as well .
An estimated 10 – 15 % of people with eating disorders are males ( Gorgan , 1999 ) .
( an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected ) .
Although eating disorders are increasing all over the world among both men and women , there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western world who are at the highest risk of developing them and the degree of westernization increases the risk .
Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder .
The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered , and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well .
Interactions between motivational , homeostatic and self-regulatory control processes are involved in eating behaviour , which is a key component in eating disorders .
The precise cause of eating disorders is not entirely understood , but there is evidence that it may be linked to other medical conditions and situations .
Cultural idealization of thinness and youthfulness have contributed to eating disorders affecting diverse populations .
One study showed that girls with ADHD have a greater chance of getting an eating disorder than those not affected by ADHD .
Another study suggested that women with PTSD , especially due to sexually related trauma , are more likely to develop anorexia nervosa .
One study showed that foster girls are more likely to develop bulimia nervosa .
Some think that peer pressure and idealized body-types seen in the media are also a significant factor .
Some research show that for certain people there are genetic reasons why they may be prone to developing an eating disorder .
Recent studies have found evidence a correlation between patients with bulimia nervosa and substance use disorders .
In addition , anxiety disorders and personality disorders are common occurrences with clients of eating disorders .
While proper treatment can be highly effective for many suffering from specific types of eating disorders , the consequences of eating disorders can be severe , including death ( whether from direct medical effects of disturbed eating habits or from comorbid conditions such as suicidal thinking ) .
when slavery abolished
Slavery in the United States existed from the early years of the colonial period ; it was firmly established by the time the United States sought independence from Great Britain in 1776 .
However , by 1804 , all states north of the Mason and Dixon Line had either abolished slavery outright or passed laws for the gradual abolition of slavery .
In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory .
But slavery gained new life in the South with the cotton industry after 1800 , and expanded into the Southwest .
The nation was polarized into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line , which separated Pennsylvania and Maryland .
The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808 , but the domestic trade , with sales to the Deep South , expanded dramatically , and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade .
Before the 1840s , the South was vigorously defending slavery and its expansion into the territories .
In the North some abolitionists denounced it as sinful , and numerous anti-slavery forces rejected it as detrimental to the rights of free men .
After failed compromises and Abraham Lincoln 's election , in 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the Confederate States of America , leading to the American Civil War .
The federal government in 1862 made abolition of slavery a war goal .
In January 1863 President Lincoln freed slaves in the Confederacy through the Emancipation Proclamation .
After the war , the Thirteenth Amendment , effective December 1865 , abolished slavery throughout the entire United States , including the Border states and the Indian territories .
From the 16th to the 19th centuries , an estimated 12 million Africans were shipped as slaves to the Americas .
See Slavery in the Americas .
The great majority went to the sugar plantations of the West Indies or Brazil , where mortality was high .
About 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States .
By the 1860 United States Census , the slave population in the American South had grown to four million .
Of all 1,515,605 families in the 15 slave states , nearly 400,000 held slaves ( roughly one in four ) , amounting to 8 % of all American families .
While some slaves worked as house servants and urban artisans , the great majority worked on plantations or large farms , cultivating lucrative cash crops , such as rice , tobacco , sugar and , after 1800 , chiefly cotton .
By 1860 most slaves were held in the Deep South , where they served in work-gangs ; two-thirds worked in cotton .
In small operations , they worked with their owners .
In large plantations they were directed by white paid overseers .
Under the system that became chattel slavery ( ownership of a human being , and of his/her descendants ) , a racial element was fundamental : slaves were blacks of African descent and owned , almost universally , by whites of European descent .
In the 17th century , Virginia , followed by other southern colonies , enacted law that children of slave mothers were born into slavery .
Slaves could gain freedom only by running away ( which was difficult and illegal to do ) , or by manumission by owners , which was regulated by states , and became increasingly difficult or prohibited .
In the earliest era of chattel slavery , the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude .
This typically lasted for several years for both poor Europeans and Africans alike , to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies .
They contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries .
Between 1680 and 1700 , as fewer Europeans migrated to the colonies , planters began to import more Africans as slaves .
Recognizing the importance of slavery , the House of Burgesses in Virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705 ; it combined a variety of legislation and added new provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law .
what produces primary xylem ?
Schematic cross section of part of leaf , xylem shown as red circles at figure 8 .
Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants ( phloem is the other ) .
The word xylem is derived from the Greek word ξύλον ( xylon ) , meaning `` wood '' ; the best-known xylem tissue is wood , though it is found throughout the plant .
Its basic function is to transport water , but it also transports some nutrients through the plant .
what are the 4 eras of time which one do we live in
This clock representation shows some of the major units of geological time and definitive events of Earth history .
The Hadean eon represents the time before fossil record of life on Earth ; its upper boundary is now regarded as 4.0 Ga ( billion years ago ) .
Other subdivisions reflect the evolution of life ; the Archean and Proterozoic are both eons , the Palaeozoic , Mesozoic and Cenozoic are eras of the Phanerozoic eon .
The two million year Quaternary period , the time of recognizable humans , is too small to be visible at this scale .
The geologic time scale is a system of chronological measurement that relates stratigraphy to time , and is used by geologists , paleontologists , and other earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred throughout Earth 's history .
The table of geologic time spans presented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy standard color codes of the International Commission on Stratigraphy .
Evidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old .
The geology or deep time of Earth 's past has been organized into various units according to events which took place in each period .
Different spans of time on the GTS are usually delimited by changes in the composition of strata which correspond to them , indicating major geological or paleontological events , such as mass extinctions .
For example , the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Paleogene period is defined by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , which marked the demise of the dinosaurs and many other groups of life .
Older time spans which predate the reliable fossil record ( before the Proterozoic Eon ) are defined by absolute age .
what is a ti 82 ?
The TI-82 is a graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments .
The TI-82 was designed in 1993 as a stripped down , more user friendly version of the TI-85 , and as a replacement for the TI-81 .
It was the direct predecessor of the TI-83 .
It shares with the TI-85 a 6 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor .
Like the TI-81 , the TI-82 features a 96x64 pixel display , and the core feature set of the TI-81 with many new features .
when character was king
The cast of characters of The King of Fighters XI .
The King of Fighters fighting game series , produced by SNK Playmore , includes a wide cast of characters , some of which are taken from other SNK games .
The story takes place in a fictional universe in which an annual series of 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 fighting tournaments are held .
The first game in the series introduces the initial main character of the series , Kyo Kusanagi , a young Japanese fighter who is the heir to a powerful group of martial artists having pyrokinetic abilities .
Kyo fights against the Kusanagi clan 's enemies , his rival Iori Yagami , and the god Orochi and its human followers , among others .
The first four games in the series revolve about these fights , while The King of Fighters '99 introduces a new story arc , revolving around K ' , a young man who seeks to destroy the mysterious NESTS organization because they kidnapped him at an early age and stripped him of his past memories , so that they could force him to be a fighter under their control .
In The King of Fighters 2003 , a new character named Ash Crimson enters the tournament , to steal the powers of the clans who sealed the Orochi in the past for an unknown reason .
A new group of antagonists , known as Those From the Past , also appears in the series ; they want to obtain Orochi 's power for the purpose of giving it to their unknown master .
The plot and the characters came from the Yamata no Orochi legend .
There are also several characters in the games that are parodies or homages to several popular anime , manga , and films .
Merchandise based on the characters has also been released , including action figures and keychains .
The characters have garnered praise from several video game publications for the quality of their designs and movesets .
Comments focused on the lack of improvements in some of the characters , but added that the roster is greatly diverse .

Where did the harpy eagle came from
The Harpy Eagle ( Harpia harpyja ) is a Neotropical species of eagle .
It is sometimes known as the American Harpy Eagle to distinguish it from the Papuan Eagle which is sometimes known as the New Guinea Harpy Eagle or Papuan Harpy Eagle .
It is the largest and most powerful raptor found in the Americas , and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world .
It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper ( emergent ) canopy layer .
Destruction of its natural habitat has seen it vanish from many parts of its former range , and it is nearly extirpated in Central America .
who invented the biological system of nomenclature used to classify plants and animals
Biological classification , or scientific classification in biology , is a method of scientific taxonomy used to group and categorize organisms into groups such as genus or species .
These groups are known as taxa ( singular : taxon ) .
Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus , who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics .
These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent .
With the introduction of the cladistic method in the late 20th century , phylogenetic taxonomy in which organisms are grouped based purely on inferred evolutionary relatedness , ignoring morphological similarity , has become common in some areas of biology .
Molecular phylogenetics , which uses DNA sequences as data , has also driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue doing so .
Biological classification belongs to the science of biological systematics .
what record company was john lennon with
Lennon 's signature
John Winston Ono Lennon , ( born John Winston Lennon ; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980 ) was an English musician , singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the Beatles , one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music .
With Paul McCartney , he formed one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century .
Born and raised in Liverpool , as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze ; his first band , the Quarrymen , evolved into the Beatles in 1960 .
As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade , Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine , and iconic songs such as `` Give Peace a Chance `` and `` Imagine `` .
After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969 , he changed his name to John Ono Lennon .
Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to raising his infant son Sean , but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy .
He was murdered three weeks after its release .
Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music , writing , drawings , on film and in interviews .
Controversial through his political and peace activism , he moved to New York City in 1971 , where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon 's administration to deport him , while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement .
As of 2012 , Lennon 's solo album sales in the United States exceed 14 million units , and as writer , co-writer or performer , he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart .
In 2002 , a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth , and in 2008 , Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time .
He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 .

when did pee wee herman hosts saturday night live
Pee-wee Herman is a comic fictional character created and portrayed by American comedian Paul Reubens .
He is best known for his two television series and film series during the 1980s .
The childlike Pee-wee Herman character developed as a stage act that quickly led to an HBO special in 1981 .
As the stage performance gained further popularity , Reubens took the character to motion picture with Pee-wee 's Big Adventure in 1985 , toning down the adult innuendo for the appeal of children .
This paved the way for Pee-wee 's Playhouse , an Emmy Award winning children 's series that ran on CBS from 1986-1991 .

who owned kansas before it became a state
Kansas ( ) is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States .
It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native American tribe , which inhabited the area .
The tribe 's name ( natively kką : ze ) is often said to mean `` people of the wind '' or `` people of the south wind , '' although this was probably not the term 's original meaning .
Residents of Kansas are called `` Kansans . ''
For thousands of years what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes .
Tribes in the Eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys .
Tribes in the Western part of the state were semi- nomadic and hunted large herds of bison .
Kansas was first settled by European Americans in the 1830s , but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue .
When officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine if Kansas would become a free state or a slave state .
Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .
The abolitionists eventually prevailed and on January 29 , 1861 , Kansas entered the Union as a free state .
After the Civil War , the population of Kansas grew rapidly , when waves of immigrants turned the prairie into farmland .
Today , Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states , producing high yields of wheat , sorghum and sunflowers .
Kansas is the 15th most extensive and the 33rd most populous of the 50 United States .
what are the three mental states in psychology
Psychology is an academic and applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental functions and behaviors .
Psychology has the immediate goal of understanding individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases , and by many accounts it ultimately aims to benefit society .
In this field , a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social , behavioral , or cognitive scientist .
Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior , while also exploring the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie certain cognitive functions and behaviors .
Psychologists explore concepts such as perception , cognition , attention , emotion , phenomenology , motivation , brain functioning , personality , behavior , and interpersonal relationships .
Psychologists of diverse stripes also consider the unconscious mind .
Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables .
In addition , or in opposition , to employing empirical and deductive methods , some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques .
Psychology has been described as a `` hub science '' , with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences , natural sciences , medicine , and the humanities , such as philosophy .
While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems , it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in many different spheres of human activity .
The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role , practicing in clinical , counseling , or school settings .
Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior , and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings ( e.g. , medical schools , hospitals ) .
Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings , or in other areas such as human development and aging , sports , health , and the media , as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law .
when did thomas jefferson become president
Thomas Jefferson ( April 13 , 1743 ( April 2 , 1743 O.S. ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father , the principal author of the Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) and the third President of the United States ( 1801–1809 ) .
At the beginning of the American Revolution , he served in the Continental Congress , representing Virginia and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia ( 1779–1781 ) .
Just after the war ended , from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat , stationed in Paris .
In May 1785 , he became the United States Minister to France .
Jefferson was the first United States Secretary of State ( 1790–1793 ) serving under President George Washington .
With his close friend James Madison he organized the Democratic-Republican Party , and subsequently resigned from Washington 's cabinet .
Elected Vice President in 1796 , when he came in second to John Adams of the Federalists , Jefferson opposed Adams and with Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions , which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts .
Elected president in what Jefferson called the Revolution of 1800 , he oversaw the purchase of the vast Louisiana Territory from France ( 1803 ) , and sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition ( 1804–1806 ) to explore the new west .
His second term was beset with troubles at home , such as the failed treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr .
With escalating trouble with Britain who was challenging American neutrality and threatening shipping at sea , he tried economic warfare with his embargo laws which only damaged American trade .
In 1803 , President Jefferson initiated a process of Indian tribal removal and relocation to the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River , in order to open lands for eventual American settlers .
A leader in the Enlightenment , Jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages fluently and was deeply interested in science , invention , architecture , religion and philosophy , interests that led him to the founding of the University of Virginia after his presidency .
He designed his own large mansion on a 5,000 acre plantation near Charlottesville , Virginia , which he named Monticello .
While not a notable orator , Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe throughout his adult life .
Though Jefferson owned many slaves , he opposed the institution all his life and consequently treated and took care of them very well and expected them to work no more than free farmers .
Since 1802 historians and others have been divided over the controversy of whether Jefferson was the father of one or more children belonging to Sally Hemings , a slave at Monticello . ''
Historians are also in disagreement with how much Jefferson was committed to the anti-slavery cause .
In 1807 , President Jefferson signed into law a bill that banned the importation of slaves into the United States .
After Martha Jefferson , his wife of eleven years , died in 1782 , Jefferson remained a widower for the rest of his life ; their marriage produced six children , of whom two survived to adulthood .
Though Jefferson has been criticized by many modern day scholars over the issue of slavery , he remains rated as one of the greatest U.S. presidents .
who sang sun city
`` Sun City '' is a 1985 protest song written by Steven Van Zandt , produced by Van Zandt and Arthur Baker and recorded by Artists United Against Apartheid to convey opposition to the South African policy of apartheid .
The primary means of that opposition is to declare that all the artists involved would refuse any and all offers to perform at Sun City , a resort which was located in Bantustan of Bophuthatswana , one of a number of internationally unrecognized supposed `` independent '' states created by the South African government to forcibly relocate its black population .

who won the most nba championships
Bill Russell won 11 championships with the Boston Celtics .
This is a list of NBA players with most championships won as a player .
The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is a major professional basketball league in North America .
It was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) .
The league adopted its current name at the start of the when it merged with the National Basketball League ( NBL ) .
The NBA Finals is the championship series for the NBA and the conclusion of the sport 's postseason .
The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy .
Players from the winning team usually receive championship rings from the team honoring their contribution .
However , in some rare occasion , the teams opted to gave other commemorative items , such as wrist watches , instead of rings .
The number of championships won by NBA superstars is often used as a measurement of their greatness .
Boston Celtics center Bill Russell holds the record for the most NBA championships won with 11 titles during his 13-year playing career .
He won his first championship with the Boston Celtics in his rookie year .
Afterwards , he went on to win 10 championships in the next 12 years , including eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966 .
He won the last two championships in 1968 and 1969 as player-coach .
Russell 's teammate , Sam Jones , won 10 championships from 1959 to 1969 , the second most in NBA history .
Four Celtics players , Tom Heinsohn , K. C. Jones , Satch Sanders and John Havlicek , won eight championships each .
Two other Celtics , Jim Loscutoff and Frank Ramsey , won seven championships each .
Four players , Bob Cousy , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen , won six championships each .
Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s .
Robert Horry and John Salley are the only players to have won the championships with three different teams .
Horry won seven championships with the Houston Rockets , the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs , while Salley won four championships with the Detroit Pistons , the Bulls and the Lakers .
Frank Saul and Steve Kerr are the only players to win two championships with two different teams in consecutive seasons .
Saul won consecutive championships with the Rochester Royals and the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950s , while Kerr won consecutive championships with the Bulls and the Spurs in the 1990s,
when editing precision means
Accuracy indicates proximity of measurement results to the true value , precision to the repeatability , or reproducibility of the measurement
In the fields of science , engineering , industry , and statistics , the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity 's actual ( true ) value .
The precision of a measurement system , also called reproducibility or repeatability , is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results .
Although the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use , they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method .
A measurement system can be accurate but not precise , precise but not accurate , neither , or both .
For example , if an experiment contains a systematic error , then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy .
The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment .
Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision .
A measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and precise .
Related terms include bias ( non- random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable ) and error ( random variability ) .
The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is , values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data .
In addition to accuracy and precision , measurements may also have a measurement resolution , which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement .
In the case of full reproducibility , such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number , the word precision has a meaning not related to reproducibility .
For example , in the IEEE 754-2008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand , so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented .
when did the word fuck begin
Fuck in its literal meaning refers to the act of sexual intercourse .
It is an English word that is often used as a profanity , either to denote disdain or as an intensifier .
The origin of the word is obscure .
It is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475 , but it may be considerably older .
In modern usage , fuck and its derivatives ( such as fucker and fucking ) can be used in the position of a noun , a verb , an adjective or an adverb .
There are many common phrases which make use of the word , as well as a number of compounds incorporating it , such as motherfucker .
what are the 7 continents
Animated , color-coded map showing the various continents and regions .
Depending on the convention and model , some continents may be consolidated or subdivided : for example , Eurasia is most often subdivided into Europe and Asia ( red shades ) , while North and South America are sometimes recognized as one American continent ( green shades ) .
A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth .
They are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria , with up to seven regions commonly regarded as continents—they are ( from largest in size to smallest ) : Asia , Africa , North America , South America , Antarctica , Europe , and Australia .
In geology , continents are described by means of tectonic plates .
Plate tectonics is the process and study of the movement , collision and division of continents , earlier known as continental drift .

what is a community property state
For the Steel Panther song , see Feel the Steel .
Community property is a marital property regime that originated in civil law jurisdictions and is now also found in some common law jurisdictions .
The states of the United States that recognize community property are primarily in the West ; it was inherited from Mexico 's ganancial community system , which itself was inherited from Spanish law ( a Roman -derived civil law system ) and ultimately from the Visigoths .
While under Spanish rule Louisiana adopted the ganancial community system of acquests and gains , which replaced the traditional French community of movables and acquests in its civil law system .
Map of the United States with community property states highlighted in red .
In addition to the highlighted states , Alaska is a separate property state that permits couples to opt into a community property arrangement .
In a community property jurisdiction , most property acquired during the marriage ( except for gifts or inheritances ) —the community , or communio bonorum—is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce , annulment or death .
Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property .
Division of community property may take place by item , by splitting all items or by value .
In some jurisdictions , such as California , a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute , meaning that the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or separate property .
In other jurisdictions , such as Texas , a divorce court may decree an `` equitable distribution `` of community property , which may result in an unequal division of such .
In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution .
Generally speaking , the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift , bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property ( i.e. , not community property ) .
See division of property .
Division of community debts may not be the same as division of community property .
For example , in California , community property is required to be divided `` equally '' while community debt is required to be divided `` equitably '' .
Property that is owned by one spouse before the marriage is the separate property of that spouse , unless the property is `` transmuted '' into community property .
The rules for this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .
what time will kate/will wedding start in united states
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge waving to the crowd at The Mall shortly after the wedding .
The wedding of Prince William , Duke of Cambridge , and Catherine Middleton took place on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey in London .
The groom , Prince William , Duke of Cambridge , is the eldest son of Charles , Prince of Wales , and is second in the line of succession to the British Throne and the thrones of fifteen other Commonwealth realms .
The bride , Catherine `` Kate '' Middleton is the eldest of three children of Michael and Carole Middleton of Bucklebury , Berkshire .
The Dean of Westminster , John Hall , presided at the service ; the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , conducted the marriage ; Richard Chartres , the Bishop of London , preached the sermon ; and a reading was given by the bride 's brother , James .
William 's best man was his brother , Prince Harry , while the bride 's sister , Pippa , was maid of honour .
The ceremony was attended by the bride 's and groom 's families , as well as many foreign royals , diplomats , and the couple 's chosen personal guests .
After the ceremony , the couple made the traditional appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace .
As Prince William was not the heir apparent to the throne , the wedding was not a full state occasion and many details were left to the couple to decide , such as much of the guest list of about 1,900 .
Prince William and Kate Middleton met in 2001 .
Their engagement on 20 October 2010 was announced on 16 November 2010 .
The build-up to the wedding and the occasion itself attracted much media attention , being compared in many ways with the 1981 marriage of William 's parents .
The occasion was a public holiday in the United Kingdom and featured many ceremonial aspects , including use of the state carriages and roles for the Foot Guards and Household Cavalry .
Events were held around the Commonwealth to mark the wedding ; organisations and hotels held events across Canada , over 5,000 street parties were held throughout the United Kingdom , and one million people lined the route between Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace .
The ceremony was viewed live by tens of millions more around the world , including 72 million on the YouTube Royal Channel .
In the United Kingdom , television audiences peaked at 26.3 million viewers , with a total of 36.7 million watching part of the coverage .

what are the parts of a hand called
A hand ( med . / lat . : manus , pl . manūs ) is a prehensile , multi- fingered extremity located at the end of an arm or forelimb of primates and humans , chimpanzees , monkeys , and lemurs .
A few other vertebrates such as the koala ( which has two opposable thumbs on each `` hand '' and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints ) are often described as having either `` hands '' or `` paws '' on their front limbs .
Hands are the main structures for physically manipulating the environment , used for both gross motor skills ( such as grasping a large object ) and fine motor skills ( such as picking up a small pebble ) .
The fingertips contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body , are the richest source of tactile feedback , and have the greatest positioning capability of the body ; thus the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands .
Like other paired organs ( eyes , feet , legs ) , each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere , so that handedness , or the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil , reflects individual brain functioning .
Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example , in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand .
The human hand has 27 bones , not including the sesamoid bones which number varies between people .
14 of which are the phalanges ( proximal , intermediate and distal ) of the fingers .
The metacarpals are the bones that connects the fingers and the wrist .
Each human hand has 5 metacarpals and 8 carpal bones .

what type of light does digital alarm clock use
Basic digital alarm clock without a radio .
The mark in the top-left of the display indicates that the time is 4:00pm , not 4:00am .
A 1969 radio alarm clock ( Sony Digimatic 8FC-59W ) with an early mechanical-digital display .
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally , i.e . in numerals or other symbols , as opposed to an analog clock , where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands .
Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives , but the `` digital '' description refers only to the display , not to the drive mechanism .
( Both analog and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically , but `` clockwork '' mechanisms with digital displays are rare . )
The biggest digital clock is the Lichtzeitpegel ( `` Light Time Level '' ) on the television tower Rheinturm Düsseldorf , Germany .

when monopoly came out
The five sets of the board game Monopoly depicted here show the evolution of the game 's artwork and designs in the United States from 1935–2005 .
The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century .
The earliest known design was by the American , Elizabeth Magie , patented in 1904 but existing as early as 1902 .
Magie 's original intent was to publish a board game to illustrate an economic principle , namely the Georgist concept of a single land value tax .
A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land .
By 1934 , a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century , and into the 21st .
Several people , mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution .
By the 1970s , the idea that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore ; it was printed in the game 's instructions for many years , in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly , and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007 .
Even a guide to family games published for Reader 's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie , erroneously stating that Magie 's original game was created in the 1800s , and not acknowledging any of the game 's development between Magie 's creation of the game , and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers .
Also in the 1970s , Professor Ralph Anspach , who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and trust busting , fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company , General Mills , over the trademarks of the Monopoly board game .
Through the research of Anspach and others , much of the early history of the game was `` rediscovered '' .
Anspach confronted Maxine Brady , author of the 1974 book The Monopoly Book : Strategy and Tactics of the World 's Most Popular Game over the actual history of the game on Barry Farber 's New York City talk show in 1975 .
Because of the lengthy court process , including appeals , the legal status of Parker Brothers ' trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985 .
The game 's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers , as do its specific design elements .
At the conclusion of the court case , the game 's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand , licensed by Parker Brothers ' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day .
Despite the `` rediscovery '' of the board game 's early history in the 1970s and 1980s , and several books and journal articles on the subject , Hasbro ( Parker Brothers ' current parent company ) did not acknowledge any of the game 's history before Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012 .
Nor did Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them , at least as recently as 2006 .
International tournaments , first held in the early 1970s , continue to the present , with the next world championship likely scheduled for 2013 .
Starting in 1985 , a new generation of spin-off board games and card games appeared on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean .
In 1989 , the first of many video game and computer game editions was published .
Since 1994 , many official variants of the game , based on locations other than Atlantic City , New Jersey ( the official U.S. setting ) or London ( the official Commonwealth setting , excepting Canada ) , have been published by Hasbro or its licensees .
In 2008 , Hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard U.S . Edition of the game to match the UK Edition , although the U.S. standard edition maintains the Atlantic City property names .
Hasbro also modified the official logo to give the `` Mr . Monopoly '' character a 3-D computer-generated look , which has since been adopted by licensees USAopoly , Winning Moves and Winning Solutions .
And Hasbro has also been including the Speed Die , introduced in 2006 's Monopoly : The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games , in versions produced directly by Hasbro ( such as the 2009 Championship Edition ) .
what is a sacrifice in baseball
In baseball , a sacrifice fly is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria:
There are fewer than two outs when the ball is hit .
The ball is hit to the outfield ( fair or foul ) , or to infield foul territory .
The batter is put out because an outfielder ( or an infielder running in the outfield , or foul territory ) catches the ball on the fly ( alternatively if the batter would have been out if not for an error or if the outfielder drops the ball and another runner is put out ) .
A runner who is already on base scores on the play .
It is called a `` sacrifice '' fly because the batter presumably intends to cause a teammate to score a run , while sacrificing his own ability to do so .
what state is Mn
Minnesota ( ) is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States .
Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory and admitted to the Union as the 32nd state on May 11 , 1858 .
Known as the `` Land of 10,000 Lakes '' , the state 's name comes from a Dakota word for `` sky-tinted water '' .
Those waters , together with forests , parks , and wilderness areas , offer residents and tourists a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities .
Minnesota is the 12th most extensive and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states .
Nearly 60 % of its residents live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area ( known as the `` Twin Cities '' ) , the center of transportation , business , industry , education , government and home to an internationally known arts community .
The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture ; deciduous forests in the southeast , now cleared , farmed and settled ; and the less populated North Woods , used for mining , forestry , and recreation .
Minnesota is known for its relatively mixed social and political orientations , and has a high rate of civic participation and voter turnout .
Minnesota ranks among the healthiest states , and has a highly literate population .
The large majority of residents are of Scandinavian and German descent .
The state is known as a center of Scandinavian American culture .
Ethnic diversity has increased in recent decades .
Substantial influxes of Asian , African , and Latin American immigrants have joined the descendants of European settlers and the original Native American inhabitants .
who do I talk to about federal grants
Grants are non-repayable funds by one party ( grant makers ) , often a government department , corporation , foundation or trust , to a , often ( but not always ) a nonprofit entity , educational institution , business or an individual .
In order to receive a grant , some form of `` Grant Writing '' often referred to as either a proposal or an application is usually required .
Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance and reporting .
The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal ( or submission ) to a potential funder , either on the applicant 's own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposal from the funder .
Other grants can be given to individuals , such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business .
Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of tax-exempt status , be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government .
For example , tiered funding for a freeway are very large grants negotiated at government policy level .
However smaller grants may be provided by a government agency ( e.g . municipal government ) .
Project-related funding involving governments , business , communities , and individuals is often arranged by application either in writing or online .
what naturally occurring isotopes does cobalt have
Naturally occurring cobalt ( Co ) is composed of 1 stable isotope , 59Co . 28 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 60Co with a half-life of 5.2714 years , 57Co with a half-life of 271.79 days , 56Co with a half-life of 77.27 days , and 58Co with a half-life of 70.86 days .
All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 18 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 second .
This element also has 11 meta states , all of which have half-lives less than 15 minutes .
The isotopes of cobalt range in atomic weight from 47Co to 75Co .
The primary decay mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope , 59Co , is electron capture and the primary mode of decay for those of greater than 59 atomic mass units is beta decay .
The primary decay products before 59Co are iron isotopes and the primary products after are nickel isotopes .
Standard atomic mass : 58.933195 ( 5 ) u

who replaced nikita khrushchev
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev ( – September 11 , 1971 ) led the Soviet Union during part of the Cold War .
He served as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964 , and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers , or Premier , from 1958 to 1964 .
Khrushchev was responsible for the partial de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union , for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program , and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy .
Khrushchev 's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964 , replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier .
Khrushchev was born in the Russian village of Kalinovka in 1894 , close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine .
He was employed as a metalworker in his youth , and during the Russian Civil War was a political commissar .
With the help of Lazar Kaganovich , he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy .
He supported Joseph Stalin 's purges , and approved thousands of arrests .
In 1939 , Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine , and he continued the purges there .
During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War ( Eastern Front of World War II ) , Khrushchev was again a commissar , serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals .
Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad , a fact he took great pride in throughout his life .
After the war , he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin 's close advisers .
In the power struggle triggered by Stalin 's death in 1953 , Khrushchev , after several years , emerged victorious .
On February 25 , 1956 , at the 20th Party Congress , he delivered the `` Secret Speech , '' denouncing Stalin 's purges and ushering in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union .
His domestic policies , aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens , were often ineffective , especially in the area of agriculture .
Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense , Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces .
Despite the cuts , Khrushchev 's rule saw the tensest years of the Cold War , culminating in the Cuban Missile Crisis .
Some of Khrushchev 's policies were seen as erratic , particularly by his emerging rivals , who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964 .
He did not suffer the deadly fate of some previous losers of Soviet power struggles , but was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside .
His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970 .
Khrushchev died in 1971 of heart disease .
what to look for with GI bleeding
Upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding refers to hemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract .
The anatomic cut-off for upper GI bleeding is the ligament of Treitz , which connects the fourth portion of the duodenum to the diaphragm near the splenic flexure of the colon .
Upper GI bleeds are considered medical emergencies , and require admission to hospital for urgent diagnosis and management .
Due to advances in medications and endoscopy , upper GI hemorrhage is now usually treated without surgery .
what percent of kids 15 and under make up the human population
World population estimates from 1800 to 2100 , based on UN 2010 projections ( red , orange , green ) and US Census Bureau historical estimates ( black ) .
Actual recorded population figures are in blue .
According to the highest estimate , the world population may rise to 16 billion by 2100 ; according to the lowest estimate , it may decline to 6 billion .
The world population is the total number of living humans on Earth .
As of today , it is estimated to number billion by the United States Census Bureau ( USCB ) .
The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12 , 2012 .
According to a separate estimate by the United Nations Population Fund , it reached this milestone on October 31 , 2011 .
The world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350 , when it stood at around 370 million .
The highest rates of growth – global population increases above 1.8 % per year – were seen briefly during the 1950s , and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s .
The growth rate peaked at 2.2 % in 1963 , and had declined to 1.1 % by 2011 .
Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million , and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million , while deaths number 56 million per year , and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 .
Current projections show a continued increase in population in the near future ( but a steady decline in the population growth rate ) , with the global population expected to reach between 7.5 and 10.5 billion by 2050 .
Various longer-term estimates predict further growth , stagnation , or even overall decline in the global population by 2150 .
Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth , citing the growing pressures on the environment , global food supplies , and energy resources .

What Are Mnemonic Devices
Knuckle mnemonic for the number of days in each month of the Gregorian Calendar .
Each projecting knuckle represents a 31-day month .
A mnemonic ( , with a silent `` m '' ) , or mnemonic device , is any learning technique that aids information retention .
Mnemonics aim to translate information into a form that the human brain can retain better than its original form .
Even the process of applying this conversion might already aid the transfer of information to long-term memory .
Commonly encountered mnemonics are often for lists and in auditory form , such as short poems , acronyms , or memorable phrases , but mnemonics can also be for other types of information and in visual or kinesthetic forms .
Their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial , personal , surprising , physical , sexual , humorous , or otherwise 'relatable ' information , rather than more abstract or impersonal forms of information .
The word mnemonic is derived from the Ancient Greek word μνημονικός ( mnēmonikos ) , meaning `` of memory '' and is related to Mnemosyne ( `` remembrance '' ) , the name of the goddess of memory in Greek mythology .
Both of these words are derived from μνήμη ( mnēmē ) , `` remembrance , memory '' .
Mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the Art of memory .
Ancient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory : the 'natural ' memory and the 'artificial ' memory .
The former is inborn , and is the one that everyone uses automatically and without thinking .
The artificial memory in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practicing of a variety of mnemonic techniques .
Mnemonic systems are special techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory , it helps employ information already stored in long-term memory to make memorization an easier task .
who passed no child left behind
President Bush signing the No Child Left Behind Act at Hamilton H.S . in Hamilton , Ohio .
The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( NCLB ) is a United States Act of Congress that is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , which included Title I , the government 's flagship aid program for disadvantaged students .
NCLB supports standards-based education reform based on the premise that setting high standards and establishing measurable goals can improve individual outcomes in education .
The Act requires states to develop assessments in basic skills .
States must give these assessments to all students at select grade levels in order to receive federal school funding .
The Act does not assert a national achievement standard ; standards are set by each individual state .
NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through annual testing , annual academic progress , report cards , teacher qualifications , and funding changes .
The bill passed in the U.S. Congress with bipartisan support .
what is a wheel well on trucks
Dodge B Series utility circa 1950 , driven by Albert Namatjira
A pickup truck or pick-up , often simply referred to as a pickup , is a light motor vehicle with an open-top , rear cargo area ( bed ) .
In North America , the term pickup is used for light trucks with a lighter duty chassis and factory built , integrated bed , as well as for coupé utility vehicles , often based on a personal car chassis , but also often on a special dedicated chassi for such use .
Some countries have their own terms similar to pickup , such as ute in Australia and New Zealand , or bakkie in South Africa .
Large pickup trucks are somewhat rare in Europe , where vans and light lorries are commonly used for similar roles .
what kind of transportation was there in the middle ages
This 15th-century depiction of Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I shows a well-bred medieval horse with arched neck , refined head and elegant gait .
Horses in the Middle Ages differed in size , build and breed from the modern horse , and were , on average , smaller .
They were also more central to society than their modern counterparts , being essential for war , agriculture , and transport .
Consequently , specific types of horse developed , many of which have no modern equivalent .
While an understanding of modern horse breeds and equestrianism is vital for any analysis of the medieval horse , researchers also need to consider documentary ( both written and pictorial ) and archaeological evidence .
Horses in the Middle Ages were rarely differentiated by breed , but rather by use .
This led them to be described , for example , as `` chargers `` ( war horses ) , `` palfreys `` ( riding horses ) , cart horses or packhorses .
Reference is also given to their place of origin , such as `` Spanish horses , '' but whether this referred to one breed or several is unknown .
Another difficulty arising during any study of medieval documents or literature is the flexibility of the medieval languages , where several words can be used for one thing ( or , conversely , several objects are referred to by one word ) .
Words such as ' courser ' and 'charger ' are used interchangeably ( even within one document ) , and where one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey , another praises its skill and swiftness .
Significant technological advances in equestrian equipment , often introduced from other cultures , allowed for significant changes in both warfare and agriculture .
In particular , improved designs for the solid-treed saddle as well as the arrival of the stirrup , horseshoe and horse collar were significant advances in medieval society .
Consequently , the assumptions and theories developed by historians are not definitive , and debate still rages on many issues , such as the breeding or size of the horse , and a number of sources must be consulted in order to understand the breadth of the subject .
what are the songs from the music man

where all deserts once lake
Largest non-polar deserts
Sand dunes in the Rub ' al Khali ( `` Empty quarter '' ) of Saudi Arabia .
Makhtesh Ramon , Negev desert , Israel
A desert is a landscape or region of land that is very dry because of low rainfall amounts ( precipitation ) , often has little coverage by plants , and in which streams dry up unless they are supplied by water from outside areas .
Deserts can also be described as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation .
Desert plants must have special adaptations to survive with this little water .
Deserts generally receive less than 25 cm of rain ( precipitation ) each year .
Semideserts or steppes are regions which receive between and .
In the Köppen climate classification system , deserts are classed as BWh ( hot desert ) or BWk ( temperate desert ) .
In the Thornthwaite climate classification system , deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates .
where did world war 1 start
World War I ( WWI ) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918 .
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939 , and the First World War or World War I thereafter .
It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) .
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers .
Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
Within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .
While the Russians mobilised , the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France , providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany .
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans .
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai .
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916 .
In Russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers .
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front , the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches .
Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 .
The war ended in victory for the Allies .
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
By the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .

when can you use a defibulator
View of defibrillator electrode position and placement .
Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia .
Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart with a device called a defibrillator .
This depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle , terminates the dysrhythmia , and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the body 's natural pacemaker , in the sinoatrial node of the heart .
Defibrillators can be external , transvenous , or implanted , depending on the type of device used or needed .
Some external units , known as automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms , meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little , or in some cases no training at all .
who created the cato institute
The Cato Institute is an American libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington , D.C .
It was founded as the Charles Koch Foundation in 1974 by Murray Rothbard , Ed Crane and Charles Koch , chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the conglomerate Koch Industries , Inc. .
In July 1976 , the name was changed to the Cato Institute .
According to the 2011 Global Go To Think Tank Index , Cato is the 6th most influential US based think tank , ranking 3rd in Economic Policy and 2nd in Social Policy .
The Institute 's stated mission is `` to increase the understanding of public policies based on the principles of limited government , free markets , individual liberty , and peace .
The Institute will use the most effective means to originate , advocate , promote , and disseminate applicable policy proposals that create free , open , and civil societies in the United States and throughout the world . ''
Cato scholars were critical of George W. Bush 's Republican administration ( 2001–2009 ) on several issues , including the Iraq War , civil liberties , education , agriculture , energy policy , and excessive government spending .
On other issues , they supported Bush administration initiatives , most notably health care , Social Security , global warming , tax policy , and immigration .
During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , Cato scholars criticized both major-party candidates , John McCain and Barack Obama .
Cato has criticized President Obama 's stances on policy issues since his inauguration , such as fiscal stimulus , healthcare reform , foreign policy , and the War on Drugs , while supporting his stance on the repeal of Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell and liberal immigration policy .

what are the players in Quidditch ?
Quidditch is a competitive sport in the wizarding world of the Harry Potter universe , and is from the series of children 's novels and movies .
It is an extremely rough but very popular semi-contact sport , played by wizards and witches .
Matches are played between two teams of seven players riding flying broomsticks , using four balls and six elevated ring-shaped goals , three on each side of the Quidditch pitch ( field ) .
In the Harry Potter universe , Quidditch holds a fervent following similar to the position that association football holds as a globally popular sport .
The sport is monumental throughout the wizarding world .
Harry plays an important position for his house team at Hogwarts : he is the seeker and becomes the captain in his sixth year there .
Regional and international competitions are mentioned throughout the series .
In Goblet of Fire , Quidditch at Hogwarts is cancelled for the Tri-Wizard Tournament , but Harry and the Weasleys attend the Quidditch World Cup .
In addition , Harry uses his Quidditch skills to capture a golden egg from a dragon called the Hungarian Horntail ( in the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament ) , to capture a flying key in Philosopher 's Stone , and on two key occasions in Deathly Hallows — getting hold of Ravenclaw 's Diadem , and during the final fight with Voldemort — the `` unerring skill of the Seeker '' is useful to him in snatching the Elder Wand out of the air .

The game has been adopted in the real world in the form of Muggle Quidditch .
what powers are specific to a particular house of Congress ?
The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States consisting of two houses : the lower house known as the House of Representatives and the upper house known as the Senate .
Congress meets in the Capitol in Washington , D.C .
Both representatives and senators are chosen through direct election .
Congress has a total of 535 voting members : 435 members in the House of Representatives and 100 members in the Senate .
Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a district .
Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results , each state in the union having at least one representative in the House of Representatives .
Regardless of population , each of the 50 states has two senators ; the 100 senators each serve a six-year term .
The terms are staggered so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election .
Each staggered group of one-third of the senators are called 'classes ' .
No state of the United States has two senators from the same class .
Most incumbents seek re-election , and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds 90 percent .
In August 2012 , a Gallup poll reported that Congress’s approval rating amongst Americans was at 10 % , matching a 38-year low reached in November 2011 .

when does a demand curve shift ?
An example of a demand curve shifting .
The shift from D1 To D2 means an increase in demand with consequences for the other variables
In economics , the demand curve is the graph depicting the relationship between the price of a certain commodity and the amount of it that consumers are willing and able to purchase at that given price .
It is a graphic representation of a demand schedule .
The demand curve for all consumers together follows from the demand curve of every individual consumer : the individual demands at each price are added together .
Demand curves are used to estimate behaviors in competitive markets , and are often combined with supply curves to estimate the equilibrium price ( the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together are willing to buy , also known as market clearing price ) and the equilibrium quantity ( the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought without surplus/excess supply or shortage/excess demand ) of that market .
In a monopolistic market , the demand curve facing the monopolist is simply the market demand curve .
what are the reasons for historical change
Historia
by Nikolaos Gysis ( 1892 )
History ( from Greek - historia , meaning `` inquiry , knowledge acquired by investigation '' ) is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the discovery , collection , organization , and presentation of information about these events .
The term includes cosmic , geologic , and organic history , but is often generically implied to mean human history .
Scholars who write about history are called historians .
History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events , and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them .
Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing `` perspective '' on the problems of the present .
Stories common to a particular culture , but not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not support the `` disinterested investigation '' required of the discipline of history .
Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory .
Herodotus , a 5th century B.C . Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the `` father of history '' , and , along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history .
Their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing .
In the Eastern tradition , a state chronicle the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived .
Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today .
The modern study of history is wide-ranging , and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation .
Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education , and the academic study of history is a major discipline in University studies .
who shot malcolm x
Malcolm X ( ; May 19 , 1925February 21 , 1965 ) , born Malcolm Little and also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz ( ) , was an African-American Muslim minister and human rights activist .
To his admirers , he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks , a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans .
Detractors accused him of preaching racism , black supremacy , and violence .
He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history .
Malcolm X 's father died—killed by white supremacists , it was rumored—when he was young , and at least one of his uncles was lynched .
When he was 13 , his mother was placed in a mental hospital , and he was placed in a series of foster homes .
In 1946 , at age 20 , he went to prison for breaking and entering .
In prison , Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam ; after his parole in 1952 , he quickly rose to become one of its leaders .
For a dozen years , Malcolm X was the public face of the controversial group , but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964 .
After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East , he returned to the United States , where he founded Muslim Mosque , Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity .
In February 1965 , less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam , he was assassinated by three members of the group .
Malcolm X 's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time .
As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught black supremacy and advocated separation of black and white Americans —in contrast to the civil rights movement 's emphasis on integration .
After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964—saying of his association with it , `` I did many things as a [ Black ] Muslim that I 'm sorry for now .
I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march '' —and becoming a Sunni Muslim , he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders , he continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism , black self-determination , and self-defense .

what type of spider has the most eyes
Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom .
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms .
Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization .
As of 2008 , at least 43,678 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however , there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900 .
Anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel .
Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae .
In all except the most primitive group , the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax .
Unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure .
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen .
Spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used .
It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders .
Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets .
True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order , the Mesothelae .
The main groups of modern spiders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appeared in the Triassic period , before .
A herbivorous species , Bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008 , but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders , although a few large species also take birds and lizards .
Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs , lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection , or running it down .
Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations , but the active hunters have acute vision , and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones .
Spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids , and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws .
Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females .
Males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans .
Females weave silk egg-cases , each of which may contain hundreds of eggs .
Females of many species care for their young , for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them .
A minority of species are social , building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals .
Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration , as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing .
Although most spiders live for at most two years , tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity .
While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans , scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides .
Spider silk provides a combination of lightness , strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials , and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories .
As a result of their wide range of behaviors , spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience , cruelty and creative powers .

What percentile is my income of 140,000 of the population ?
US county household median income 2009 .
Median US household income , 2001-2011
Household income is a measure commonly used by the United States government and private institutions .
Each household is measured by the income of every resident over the age of 15 .
Income includes wages and salaries , unemployment insurance , disability payments , child support payments received , regular rental receipts , as well as any personal business , investment , or other kinds of income received routinely .
While inflation-adjusted ( `` real '' ) household income had been increasing almost every year from 1945 to 1999 , it has since been flat and even decreased recently .
U.S. median household income fell from $ 51,144 in 2010 to $ 50,502 in 2011 .
Extreme poverty in the United States , meaning households living on less than $ 2 per day before government benefits , doubled from 1996 to 1.5 million households in 2011 , including 2.8 million children .
The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
As households tend to share a similar economic context , the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income .
That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories , and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible .
what is a registered agent for an llc
A registered agent , also known as a resident agent or statutory agent , in United States business law , is a business or individual designated to receive service of process ( SOP ) when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons .

Competitive Fencing is one of five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games , the other four being Athletics , Cycling , Swimming , and Gymnastics .
what are the quad muscles
The quadriceps femoris ( Latin for `` four-headed muscle of the femur `` ) , also called simply the quadriceps , quadriceps extensor , quads , is a large muscle group that includes the four prevailing muscles on the front of the thigh .
It is the great extensor muscle of the knee , forming a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the femur .
The proper Latin plural form of the adjective quadriceps would be quadricipites .
In modern English usage , quadriceps is used in both singular and plural .
The singular form quadricep , produced by hypercorrection , is frequently used .
when did the titanic sink
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton , UK to New York City , US .
The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history .
The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage .
She was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line , and she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews , who perished with the ship , as her naval architect .
On her maiden voyage , she carried 2,224 passengers and crew .
Under the command of Edward Smith , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America .
The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury , with an on-board gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high-class restaurants and opulent cabins .
She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use .
Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard .
Because of outdated maritime safety regulations , she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number travelling on the maiden voyage , and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity .
After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York .
On 14 April 1912 , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship 's time .
The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; the ship gradually filled with water .
Meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partly loaded .
A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a `` women and children first `` protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats .
By 2:20 AM , she broke apart and foundered , with well over one thousand people still aboard .
Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered , the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors .
The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it .
Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety .
One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) , which still governs maritime safety today .
Additionally , several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- -which could have saved many more passengers .
Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute ; many families , particularly those of crew members from Southampton , lost their primary bread-winners .
They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations .
Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board ; the White Star Line 's chairman , J. Bruce Ismay , faced social ostracism for the rest of his life .
The wreck of the Titanic remains on the seabed , split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of .
Since its discovery in 1985 , thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world .
Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history , her memory kept alive by numerous books , folk songs , films , exhibits , and memorials .

when was james madison in the house of representatives
James Madison , Jr. ( March 16 , 1751 ( O.S . March 5 ) – June 28 , 1836 ) was an American statesman and political theorist , the fourth President of the United States ( 1809–1817 ) .
He is hailed as the “Father of the Constitution” for being instrumental in the drafting of the United States Constitution and as the key champion and author of the United States Bill of Rights .
He served as a politician much of his adult life .
After the constitution had been drafted , Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify it .
His collaboration with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay produced the Federalist Papers ( 1788 ) .
Circulated only in New York at the time , they would later be considered among the most important polemics in support of the Constitution .
He was also a delegate to the Virginia constitutional ratifying convention , and was instrumental to the successful ratification effort in Virginia .
Like most of his contemporaries , Madison changed his political views during his life .
During the drafting and ratification of the constitution , he favored a strong national government , though later he grew to favor stronger state governments , before settling between the two extremes late in his life .
In 1789 , Madison became a leader in the new House of Representatives , drafting many basic laws .
He is notable for drafting the first ten amendments to the Constitution , and thus is known as the `` Father of the Bill of Rights `` .
Madison worked closely with President George Washington to organize the new federal government .
Breaking with Hamilton and what became the Federalist Party in 1791 , Madison and Thomas Jefferson organized what they called the Republican Party ( later called by historians the Democratic-Republican Party )
As Jefferson’s Secretary of State ( 1801–1809 ) , Madison supervised the Louisiana Purchase , which doubled the nation’s size .
After his election to the presidency , he presided over renewed prosperity for several years .
As president ( 1809–17 ) , after the failure of diplomatic protests and a trade embargo against Great Britain , he led the nation into the War of 1812 .
He was responding to British encroachments on American honor and rights ; in addition , he wanted to end the influence of the British among their Indian allies , whose resistance blocked United States settlement in the Midwest around the Great Lakes .
Madison found the war to be an administrative nightmare , as the United States had neither a strong army nor financial system ; as a result , he afterward supported a stronger national government and a strong military , as well as the national bank , which he had long opposed .
Like other Virginia statesmen in the slave society , he was a slaveholder who inherited his plantation known as Montpelier , and owned hundreds of slaves during his lifetime to cultivate tobacco and other crops .
Madison supported the three-fifths compromise that allowed three-fifths of the enumerated population of slaves to be counted for representation .

It is part of the eCLipz project , said to have a goal of converging IBM 's server hardware where practical ( hence `` ipz '' in the acronym : iSeries , pSeries , and zSeries ) .
what is middle class in the us
The American middle class is a social class in the United States .
While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use , contemporary social scientists have put forward several , more or less congruent , theories on the American middle class .
Depending on class model used , the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25 % to 66 % of households .
One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was White Collar : The American Middle Classes , published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Wright_Mills Mills Wright_Mills .
Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups .
Constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated , salaried professionals and managers .
Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals , skilled craftsmen and lower-level management .
Middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living , significant economic security , considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves .
Members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other .
Overall , middle-class persons , especially upper-middle-class individuals , are characterized by conceptualizing , creating and consulting .
Thus , college education is one of the main indicators of middle-class status .
Largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations , middle class values tend to emphasize independence , adherence to intrinsic standards , valuing innovation and respecting non-conformity .
Politically more active than other demographics , college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties .
Income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of $ 100,000 .
Household income figures , however , do not always reflect class status and standard of living , as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size .
It is therefore possible for a large , dual-earner , lower middle class household to out-earn a small , one-earner , upper middle class household .
The middle classes are very influential , as they encompass the majority of voters , writers , teachers , journalists , and editors .
Most societal trends in the US originate within the middle classes .

what is considered to be a disasters
Ruins from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in United States history
A disaster is a natural or man-made ( or technological ) hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction , loss of life , or drastic change to the environment .
A disaster can be ostensively defined as any tragic event stemming from events such as earthquakes , floods , catastrophic accidents , fires , or explosions .
It is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life and property and destroy the economic , social and cultural life of people .
In contemporary academia , disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk .
These risks are the product of a combination of both hazard/s and vulnerability .
Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters , as is the case in uninhabited regions .
Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by disasters occur in developing countries , and losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater ( as a percentage of GDP ) in developing countries than in industrialized countries .
What is the first program to run during a system boot sequence ?
In computing , booting ( also known as booting up ) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on .
The process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is re-energized after being turned off , and ends when the computer is ready to perform its normal operations .
On modern general purpose computers , this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a power-on self-test , locating and initializing peripheral devices , and then finding , loading and starting an operating system .
Many computer systems also allow these operations to be initiated by a software command without cycling power , in what is known as a soft reboot , though some of the initial operations might be skipped on a soft reboot .
A boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the self-tests .
The computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by one 's bootstraps .
The usage calls attention to the requirement that , if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer , some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computer .
Early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem .
The invention of integrated circuit read-only memory ( ROM ) of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erased .
Growth in the capacity of ROM has allowed ever more elaborate start up procedures to be implemented .
On general purpose computers , the boot process begins with the execution of an initial program stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashion .
In some older computers , the initial program might have been the application to run , if no operating system was used , or the operating system .
In other computers , the initial program is a boot loader that may then load into random-access memory ( RAM ) , from nonvolatile secondary storage ( such as a hard disk drive ) or , in some older computers , from a medium such as punched cards , punched tape , or magnetic tape in older computers , the binary code of an operating system or runtime environment and then execute it .
If the boot loader is limited in its size and capabilities , it may , instead , load a larger and more capable secondary boot loader , which would then load the operating system or runtime environment .
Some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in ROM .
What is firebird server
Firebird is an open source SQL relational database management system that runs on Linux , Windows , and a variety of Unix .
The database forked from Borland 's open source edition of InterBase in 2000 , but since Firebird 1.5 the code has been largely rewritten .
what is the rationale for outsourcing in firms
Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization .
The practice of contracting a business process out to a third party rather than staffing it internally is common in the modern economy .
The term `` outsourcing '' became popular in the United States near the turn of the 21st century .
Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another , but not always .
The definition of outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting , and sometimes includes offshoring , which means relocating a business function to another country .
Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for outsourcing/offshoring .
The opposite of outsourcing is called insourcing , which entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house , and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration .
However , a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily insourcing that business process .
What is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ?
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a lentivirus ( slowly replicating retrovirus ) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive .
Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood , semen , vaginal fluid , pre-ejaculate , or breast milk .
Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells .
HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4 + T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells .
HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms including : apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells .
When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections .
when were the first firemen
The firepole in a fire station in Toronto
A fireman 's pole ( also called a sliding pole or firepole ) is a wooden pole or a metal tube or pipe installed between floors in fire stations , allowing firefighters responding to an alarm to quickly descend to the ground floor faster than by using a standard staircase .
The device was invented in the 1870s by David Kenyon , in Chicago , Illinois , although it is often incorrectly credited to the Boston Fire Department .
When was the first Mary Poppins book written
Mary Poppins is the title character of a series of children 's books written by P. L. Travers .
Throughout the Mary Poppins series , which lasted from 1934 to 1988 , Mary Shepard was the illustrator and acted as a second author .
The books centre on a magical English nanny , Mary Poppins .
She is blown by the East wind to Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane , London , and into the Banks ' household to care for their children .
Encounters with chimney sweeps , shopkeepers and various adventures follow until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves , i.e. , `` pops-out '' .
The adventures take place over a total of eight books .
However , only the first three books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving .
The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits .
As P. L. Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park , `` She can not forever arrive and depart . ''
The books were adapted in 1964 into a musical Disney film starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke .
In 2004 , Disney Theatrical produced a stage musical adaptation in the West End theatre .
The stage musical was transferred to Broadway in 2006 where it ran until its closing on March 3 , 2013 .
It has been highly successful , as was the 1964 film .
What is the name of the main male character in the last song that miley falls in love with
The Last Song is a 2010 American coming of age teen romantic drama film developed alongside Nicholas Sparks ' novel by the same name .
The film was directed by Julie Anne Robinson in her feature film directorial debut and co-written by Sparks and Jeff Van Wie .
The Last Song stars Miley Cyrus , Liam Hemsworth , and Greg Kinnear and follows a troubled teenager as she reconnects with her estranged father and falls in love during a summer in a quiet Southern United States beach town .
The film is distributed by Touchstone Pictures .
Sparks was approached to write both the film 's screenplay and the novel .
Sparks completed the screenplay in January 2009 , prior to the completion of the novel , making The Last Song his first script to be optioned for film .
The setting , originally in North Carolina like the novel , moved to Georgia after the states had campaigned for months to host production .
Upon beginning production in Tybee Island , Georgia and nearby Savannah , The Last Song became the first movie to be both shot and set in Tybee Island .
Filming lasted from June 15 to August 18 , 2009 with much of it occurring on the island 's beach and pier .
The Last Song was originally scheduled for wide release on January 8 , 2010 , but was postponed to March 31 , 2010 .
what is sims language
Written Simlish
Simlish is a fictional language featured in EA Games ' Sim series of games .
It debuted in SimCopter , and has been especially prominent in The Sims , The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 .
The Sims development team created the unique Simlish language by experimenting with fractured Ukrainian , French , Latin , Finnish , English , Fijian , Cebuano , and Tagalog .
Simlish can also be heard in SimCity 4 , SimCity Societies and SimCity 2013 , but far less frequently .
Civilized Creatures in Spore can also be taught to speak Simlish .
It is also featured to an extent in Firaxis Games ' Sid Meier 's SimGolf .
Designer Will Wright was conscious of the need for dialogue in the game , but thought that using a real language would make it sound too repetitive and would also be too costly to hire translators for world languages .
Initially , inspired by the Native American code talkers of World War II , Sims creator Will Wright and language expert Marc Gimbel suggested experimenting with the Navajo language to create Simlish .
However , they ultimately decided that Simlish worked best as a `` language '' made up of gibberish words that could n't be translated , so that its meaning would be left open to the imagination of the player .
Wright later commented that using `` nonsense language '' turned out to be the right development choice , as people were capable of imagining it more realistically than a computer could simulate a real one .
The actual sound of Simlish was created improvisationally by voice actors Stephen Kearin and Gerri Lawlor .
what is UT testing
An example of Ultrasonic Testing ( UT ) on blade roots of a V2500 IAE aircraft engine .
Step 1 : The UT probe is placed on the root of the blades to be inspected with the help of a special borescope tool ( video probe ) .
Step 2 : Instrument settings are input .
Step 3 : The probe is scanned over the blade root .
In this case , an indication ( peak in the data ) through the red line ( or gate ) indicates a good blade ; an indication to the left of that range indicates a crack .
Principle of ultrasonic testing .
LEFT : A probe sends a sound wave into a test material .
There are two indications , one from the initial pulse of the probe , and the second due to the back wall echo .
RIGHT : A defect creates a third indication and simultaneously reduces the amplitude of the back wall indication .
The depth of the defect is determined by the ratio D/E
In ultrasonic testing ( UT ) , very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz and occasionally up to 50 MHz are launched into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials .
A common example is ultrasonic thickness measurement , which tests the thickness of the test object , for example , to monitor pipework corrosion .
Ultrasonic testing is often performed on steel and other metals and alloys , though it can also be used on concrete , wood and composites , albeit with less resolution .
It is a form of non-destructive testing used in many industries including aerospace , automotive and other transportation sectors .
what is the function of the vas deferens ?
The vas deferens ( plural : vasa deferentia ) , also called ductus deferens ( Latin : `` carrying-away vessel '' ; plural : ductus deferentes ) , is part of the male anatomy of many vertebrates ; they transport sperm from the epididymis in anticipation of ejaculation .
What is Ischemia or infarction ?
Vascular ischemia of the toes with characteristic cyanosis .
In medicine , ischemia , also spelled as ischaemia or ischæmia , ( ; from Greek language ισχαιμία , ischaimía ; isch- root denoting a restriction or thinning or to make or grow thin/lean , haema blood ) is a restriction in blood supply to tissues , causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism ( to keep tissue alive ) .
Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels , with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue .
It also means local anemia in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion ( such as vasoconstriction , thrombosis or embolism ) .
what is the lifespan of a down 's syndrome individual
Down syndrome ( DS ) or Down 's syndrome , also known as trisomy 21 , is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21 .
Down syndrome is the most common chromosome abnormality in humans .
It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability ( mental retardation , or MR ) and physical growth , and a particular set of facial characteristics .
The average IQ of young adults with Down syndrome is around 50 , whereas young adults without the condition typically have an IQ of 100 .
( MR has historically been defined as an IQ below 70 . )
A large proportion of individuals with Down syndrome have a severe degree of intellectual disability .
Down syndrome is named after John Langdon Down , the British physician who described the syndrome in 1866 .
The condition was clinically described earlier by Jean Etienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and Edouard Seguin in 1844 .
Down syndrome was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by Dr. Jérôme Lejeune in 1959 .
Down syndrome can be identified in a baby at birth or before birth by prenatal screening .
Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated .
The CDC estimates that about one of every 691 babies born in the United States each year is born with Down syndrome .
Many children with Down syndrome are educated in regular school classes while others require specialised educational facilities .
Some children graduate from high school , and , in the US , there are increasing opportunities for participating in post-secondary education .
Education and proper care has been shown to improve quality of life significantly .
Many adults with Down Syndrome are able to work at paid employment in the community , while others require a more sheltered work environment .
WHAT IS COLD FLUSH

When was the Montgomery bill founded ?
The Servicemen 's Readjustment Act of 1944 ( P.L . 78-346 , 58 Stat . 284m ) , known informally as the G.I . Bill , was a law that provided a range of benefits for returning World War II veterans ( commonly referred to as G.I.s ) .
Benefits included low-cost mortgages , low-interest loans to start a business or farm , cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend college , high school or vocational education , as well as one year of unemployment compensation .
It was available to every veteran who had been on active duty during the war years for at least ninety days and had not been dishonorably discharged ; combat was not required .
By the end of the program in 1956 , roughly 2.2 million veterans had used the G.I . Bill education benefits in order to attend colleges or universities , and an additional 6.6 million used these benefits for some kind of training program .
Since the original 1944 law , the term has come to include other veteran benefit programs created to assist veterans of subsequent wars as well as peacetime service .
Historians and economists consider the G.I . Bill a major political success—especially in contrast to the treatments of World War I veterans—and a major contribution to America 's stock of human capital that sped long-term economic growth .
what was nixon accused of
The Watergate scandal was a political scandal that occurred in the United States in the 1970s as a result of the June 17 , 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington , D.C. , and the Nixon administration 's attempted cover-up of its involvement .
The scandal eventually led to the resignation of Richard Nixon , the President of the United States , on August 9 , 1974 — the only resignation of a U.S. President .
The scandal also resulted in the indictment , trial , conviction , and incarceration of forty-three persons , dozens of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials .
The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate complex on June 17 , 1972 .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) connected cash found on the burglars to a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President , the official organization of Nixon 's campaign .
In July 1973 , as evidence mounted against the president 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee , it was revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and he had recorded many conversations .
Recordings from these tapes implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up the questionable ( and illegal ) goings-on that had taken place during his administration , both before and after the break-in .
After a protracted series of bitter court battles , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president had to hand over the tapes to government investigators ; he ultimately complied .
Facing near-certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and a strong possibility of a conviction in the Senate , Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9 , 1974 .
His successor , Gerald Ford , then issued a pardon to him .

what is reagan known for
The United States presidency of Ronald Reagan , also known as the Reagan administration , was a Republican administration headed by Ronald Reagan from January 20 , 1981 , to January 20 , 1989 .
Domestically , the administration favored reducing government programs and introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in American history .
The economic policies enacted in 1981 , known as `` Reaganomics `` , were an example of supply-side economics .
Reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and limit the growth of social spending , as well as the reduction of regulation and inflation .
Economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s , helping Reagan to win a landslide re-election .
The national debt increased significantly , however .
Regarding foreign policy , the administration was steadfastly anti-communist , calling the Soviet Union an `` evil empire `` and ending 1970s détente .
Reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor , including an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War .
The `` Reagan Doctrine `` controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow communist governments , particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan .
Reagan also promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems in order to confront the Soviets and their allies .
In diplomacy , Reagan forged a strong alliance with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and he met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev four times , aiming to shrink the superpowers ' nuclear arsenals .
Reagan 's presidency has been termed the `` Reagan Revolution '' , or the Age of Reagan in recognition of the political realignment both within and beyond the U.S. in favor of his brand of conservatism and his faith in free markets .
The Reagan administration worked toward the collapse of Soviet Communism , and it did collapse just as he left office .
Victory in the Cold War led to a unipolar world with the U.S. as the world 's sole superpower .
While the damaging Iran-Contra affair engulfed several Reagan aides during his second term , Reagan himself left office with a 63 percent approval rating , one of the higher approval ratings of departing presidents .
After years of unstinting praise from the right , and unrelenting criticism from the left , historian David Henry finds that by 2009 a consensus had emerged among scholars that Reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a `` pragmatic conservatism '' that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system .
Furthermore , says Henry , the consensus viewpoint agrees that he revived faith in the presidency and American self-confidence , and contributed critically to ending the Cold War .
what was the crude death rate in 1990 ?
Crude death rate by country ( 2006 ) .
Mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths ( in general , or due to a specific cause ) in a population .
Scaled to the size of that population , per unit of time .
Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year ; thus , a mortality rate of 9.5 ( out of 1000 ) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population , or 0.95 % out of the total .
It is distinct from morbidity rate , which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period ( the prevalence rate ) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ( incidence rate ) .
The term `` mortality `` is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury , rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group .
This disease mortality statistic is more precisely referred to as `` case fatality rate `` ( CFR ) .
One distinguishes:
The crude death rate , the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people .
the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 per 1000 per year according to the current CIA World Factbook .
The perinatal mortality rate , the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths ( stillbirths ) per 1000 births .
The maternal mortality ratio , the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in same time period .
The maternal mortality rate , the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population ( generally defined as 15–44 years of age ) .
The infant mortality rate , the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live births .
The child mortality rate , the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live births .
The standardised mortality ratio ( SMR ) - This represents a proportional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age , gender , etc .
The age-specific mortality rate ( ASMR ) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age ( e.g . age 62 last birthday ) .
In regard to the or failure of medical treatment or procedures , one would also distinguish:
The early mortality rate , the total number of deaths in the early stages of an ongoing treatment , or in the period immediately following an treatment .
The late mortality rate , the total number of deaths in the late stages of an ongoing treatment , or a significant length of time after an acute treatment .
Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression .
The crude death rate depends on the age ( and gender ) specific mortality rates and the age ( and gender ) distribution of the population .
The number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries , despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better .
This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution , with a much higher proportion of older people , due to both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates .
A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate separately for each age .
A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy .
what is evoked otoacoustic emissions
An otoacoustic emission ( OAE ) is a sound which is generated from within the inner ear .
Having been predicted by Thomas Gold in 1948 , its existence was first demonstrated experimentally by David Kemp in 1978 and otoacoustic emissions have since been shown to arise by a number of different cellular mechanisms within the inner ear .
Studies have shown that OAEs disappear after the inner ear has been damaged , so OAEs are often used in the laboratory and the clinic as a measure of inner ear health .
Broadly speaking , there are two types of otoacoustic emissions : spontaneous otoacoustic emissions ( SOAEs ) , which can occur without external stimulation , and evoked otoacoustic emissions ( EOAEs ) , which require an evoking stimulus .
where was thomas located on october 27
Hurricane Tomas was the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season .
Tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the Windward Islands on October 29 .
Quickly intensifying into a hurricane , it moved through the Windward Islands and passed very near Saint Lucia .
After reaching Category 2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale , Tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central Caribbean Sea , due to strong wind shear and dry air .
Tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the Windward passage .
Throughout the hurricane 's path , 71 people are known to have been killed , 14 of whom were in Saint Lucia .
Monetary losses throughout the Windward Islands were estimated at US $ 588 million , mainly in Saint Lucia .
In the wake of the storm in Haiti , flooding intensified an ongoing cholera outbreak indirectly causing more fatalities .
According to a report released in December 2010 , 55 people were killed in Cuba and Hispanola , though the distribution of these fatalities are unknown .
Overall damage from the storm was at least $ 741 million .

what was the post modernist era in literature ?
Postmodern literature is literature characterized by heavy reliance on techniques like fragmentation , paradox , and questionable narrators , and is often ( though not exclusively ) defined as a style or trend which emerged in the post–World War II era .
Postmodern works are seen as a reaction against Enlightenment thinking and Modernist approaches to literature .
Postmodern literature , like postmodernism as a whole , tends to resist definition or classification as a `` movement '' .
Indeed , the convergence of postmodern literature with various modes of critical theory , particularly reader-response and deconstructionist approaches , and the subversions of the implicit contract between author , text and reader by which its works are often characterised , have led to pre-modern fictions such as Cervantes ' Don Quixote ( 1605,1615 ) and Laurence Sterne 's eighteenth-century satire Tristram Shandy being retrospectively inducted into the fold .
While there is little consensus on the precise characteristics , scope , and importance of postmodern literature , as is often the case with artistic movements , postmodern literature is commonly defined in relation to a precursor .
For example , a postmodern literary work tends not to conclude with the neatly tied-up ending as is often found in modernist literature , but often parodies it .
Postmodern authors tend to celebrate chance over craft , and further employ metafiction to undermine the writer 's authority .
Another characteristic of postmodern literature is the questioning of distinctions between high and low culture through the use of pastiche , the combination of subjects and genres not previously deemed fit for literature .

what is the federal death tax
The estate tax in the United States is a tax imposed on the transfer of the `` taxable estate `` of a deceased person , whether such property is transferred via a will , according to the state laws of intestacy or otherwise made as an incident of the death of the owner , such as a transfer of property from an intestate estate or trust , or the payment of certain life insurance benefits or financial account sums to beneficiaries .
The estate tax is one part of the Unified Gift and Estate Tax system in the United States .
The other part of the system , the gift tax , imposes a tax on transfers of property during a person 's life ; the gift tax prevents avoidance of the estate tax should a person want to give away his/her estate .
In addition to the federal government , many states also impose an estate tax , with the state version called either an estate tax or an inheritance tax .
Opponents of the estate tax call it the `` death tax '' .
If an asset is left to a spouse or a Federally recognized charity , the tax usually does not apply .
In addition , up to $ 5,250,000 can be given by an individual , before and/or upon their death , without incurring federal gift or estate taxes .

when was raphael born
Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino ( April 6 or March 28 , 1483 – April 6 , 1520 ) , better known simply as Raphael , was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance .
His work is admired for its clarity of form and ease of composition and for its visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur .
Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci , he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period .
Raphael was enormously productive , running an unusually large workshop , and despite his death at 37 , a large body of his work remains .
Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace , where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central , and the largest , work of his career .
The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura .
After his early years in Rome much of his work was self-designed , but for the most part executed by the workshop from his drawings , with considerable loss of quality .
He was extremely influential in his lifetime , though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking .
After his death , the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries , when Raphael 's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models .
His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles , first described by Giorgio Vasari : his early years in Umbria , then a period of about four years ( from 1504–1508 ) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence , followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome , working for two Popes and their close associates .

What Is the Largest Whale
The blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) is a marine mammal belonging to the suborder of baleen whales ( called Mysticeti ) .
At in length and or more in weight , it is the largest known animal to have ever existed .
Long and slender , the blue whale 's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath .
There are at least three distinct subspecies : B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific , B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda ( also known as the pygmy blue whale ) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean .
B. m. indica , found in the Indian Ocean , may be another subspecies .
As with other baleen whales , its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill .
Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the beginning of the twentieth century .
For over a century , they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966 .
A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide , located in at least five groups .
More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate .
Before whaling , the largest population was in the Antarctic , numbering approximately 239,000 ( range 202,000 to 311,000 ) .
There remain only much smaller ( around 2,000 ) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific , Antarctic , and Indian Ocean groups .
There are two more groups in the North Atlantic , and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere .

The uncultivated or wild variety of the species is called a cardoon .
It is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region .
who is on the hundred dollar bill
The United States one hundred-dollar bill ( $ 100 ) is a denomination of United States currency .
U.S. statesman , inventor , and diplomat Benjamin Franklin is currently featured on the obverse of the bill .
On the reverse of the banknote is an image of Independence Hall .
The $ 100 bill is the largest denomination that has been printed since July 13 , 1969 , when the denominations of $ 500 , $ 1,000 , $ 5,000 , and $ 10,000 were retired .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing says the average life of a $ 100 bill in circulation is 90 months ( 7.5 years ) before it is replaced due to wear and tear .
The bills are also commonly referred to as `` Benjamins '' , in reference to the use of Benjamin Franklin 's portrait on the denomination , or `` C-Notes '' , based on the Roman numeral for 100 .
The bill is one of two denominations printed today that does not feature a President of the United States ; the other is the $ 10 bill , featuring Alexander Hamilton .
The time on the clock of Independence Hall on the reverse , according to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing , shows approximately 4:10 .
One hundred hundred-dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in mustard-colored straps ( $ 10,000 ) .
The Series 2009 $ 100 bill redesign was unveiled on April 21 , 2010 , and was to be issued to the public on February 11 , 2011 , but production was shut down in December 2010 because as many as 30 % were unusable due to a manufacturing flaw .
A vertical crease in the paper reveals a blank space on the bill when pulled out .
In their replacement , and continuing the high demand of this denomination , the Series 2006A was launched retaining the previous design ( 1996-generation ) .
On April 24 , 2013 , the Federal Reserve announced the new $ 100 bill would enter circulation on October 8 , 2013 .

The city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley .
Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu .
Most of Kathmandu 's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism .
There are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture .
Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city .
Nepal Bhasa is the indigenous language spoken by the Newar people .
Hindi is widely understood and English is understood by Kathmandu 's educated residents .
The city 's literacy rate is 98 % .
Kathmandu 's sister cities ( Lalitpur Patan ) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu 's cultural heritage , tourism industry , and economy ; therefore UNESCO 's World Heritage Site lists all three cities ' monuments and attractions together under one heading , `` Kathmandu Valley- UNESCO World Heritage Site `` .
what is the system in field hockey
Field hockey , usually referred to simply as hockey , is a team sport of the hockey family which is played between two teams of eleven players with hockey sticks and a hard , solid plastic ball .
At the turn of the 21st century , the game is played globally , with particular popularity throughout Europe , Asia , Oceania , and South America – in addition to being the national sport of Pakistan and India .
The term `` field hockey '' is used primarily in Canada , the United States , and other regions of the world where the sport of ice hockey is more popular .
During play , goal keepers are the only players who are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body ( with the exception of a player 's hand considered 'part of the stick ' ) , with this only applying within the shooting circle ( also known as the D , or shooting arc , or just the circle ) , while field players play the ball with the flat side of their stick .
The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins .
If the score is tied at the end of the game , either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout , depending on the competition 's format .
The governing body of hockey is the International Hockey Federation ( FIH ) , with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic games , Commonwealth games , Hockey World Cup , Champions Trophy and Junior Hockey World Cup , with many countries running extensive junior , senior , and masters ' club competitions .
The FIH is also responsible for organising the Hockey Rules Board and developing the rules for the sport .
A popular variant of field hockey is indoor hockey , which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey .
Indoor hockey is a 6-a-side variant , with a field which is reduced to approximately 40m × 20m .
With many of the rules remaining the same , including obstruction and feet , there are several key variations - Players may not raise the ball unless shooting on goal , players may not hit the ball ( instead utilising pushes to transfer the ball ) , and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers which the ball will rebound off .
where is cane from the young and the restless
Ethan `` Cane '' Ashby ( né Atkinson ) is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless .
He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard , who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended for a role on The Young and the Restless instead .
The role was to be portrayed as an American , but Goddard 's Australian descent influenced the character 's background .
Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12 , 2007 as an Australian bartender in search of his family , a debut that received a mixed response .
Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II ( Donnelly Rhodes ) and Jill Foster Abbott ( Jess Walton ) but the character 's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009 , reestablishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson ( Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis ) .
Though characterized as `` mysterious '' , Cane is `` loyal and dedicated '' , while Goddard described the character as a `` typical Australian , working-class kind of guy '' .
He was the first member of the Atkinson family to appear on the series , followed by his parents and identical twin brother .
Soon after his debut , he became a leading character , a decision praised by viewers and critics .
The character has been involved with Amber Moore ( Adrienne Frantz ) , Chloe Mitchell ( Elizabeth Hendrickson ) and most notably Lily Winters ( Christel Khalil ) , a romance that garnered significant fan attention .
In 2009 , Cane and Lily were married ; Global BC would later call Lily the love of Cane 's life .
The pair had two children , Charlie and Mattie Ashby .
In 2011 , the actor was fired , and Cane was shot to death onscreen .
However , Goddard was rehired soon after viewers campaigned for his return , revealing that Cane 's identical twin brother was in fact the man who died .
This sacrificed his marriage to Lily , but the couple were remarried on Valentine 's Day in 2012 .
Goddard has been widely acclaimed for his portrayal ; Canyon News said that he portrays the character honestly , and is `` always dependable , on fire and exciting '' .

When was the first world wide web created
The World Wide Web ( abbreviated as WWW or W3 , commonly known as the web ) , is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet .
With a web browser , one can view web pages that may contain text , images , videos , and other multimedia , and navigate between them via hyperlinks .
Using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like ENQUIRE , British engineer , computer scientist and at that time employee of the CERN , Sir Tim Berners-Lee , now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web .
At CERN , a European research organisation near Geneva straddling the border between France and Switzerland , Berners-Lee and Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed in 1990 to use hypertext `` to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will '' , and they publicly introduced the project in December of the same year .
where is mark sanchez from
Mark Travis John Sanchez ( born November 11 , 1986 ) is an American football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
He was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft as the fifth overall selection by the Jets and the second quarterback taken overall .
He played college football at the University of Southern California ( USC ) .
Sanchez grew up in a well-disciplined and athletic family .
In the eighth grade , he began to play football and learn the intricacies of the quarterback position , training with his father , Nick .
A well-regarded prospect , Sanchez committed to Southern California following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his final season .
At USC , Sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty .
Sanchez also became popular within the community due to his Mexican-American heritage .
Named the starter in 2008 , Sanchez led USC to a 12–1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State for which Sanchez was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense .
Although many considered him too inexperienced , Sanchez announced his intention to enter the 2009 NFL Draft .
He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns , and was named the starting quarterback prior to the start of the season .
Despite a subpar performance , Sanchez led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game , a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts , becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games .
In his second season , Sanchez continued to develop and led the Jets to the playoffs and the team 's second consecutive AFC Championship Game where they narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers , 24–19 .
With the win over the New England Patriots the week prior , Sanchez tied four other quarterbacks for the second most post-season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history .
In leading the Jets to two consecutive conference championships , Sanchez joined quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league .
The next two seasons would be a regression for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs .
Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched .
He eventually was replaced towards the end of the 2012 season with Greg McElroy .

what is sump pump used for
A small submersible AC sump pump with a garden hose connector
A sump pump is a pump used to remove water that has accumulated in a water collecting sump basin , commonly found in the basement of homes .
The water may enter via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system , funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water , if the basement is below the water table level .
Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to remedy dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home .
Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic , such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well .
Pumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations .
Once considered acceptable , this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws , because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system .
Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers .
Fines may be imposed for noncompliance .
Many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges to the sewer .
If the discharge is fed to a laundry sink in the basement , it 's likely going to the sewer .
Usually hardwired into a home 's electrical system , sump pumps may have a battery backup .
The home 's pressurized water supply powers some pumps , eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable water , potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem .
Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped , a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time , as during a severe storm .
There are generally two types of sump pumps — pedestal and submersible .
The pedestal pump 's motor is mounted above the sump , where it is more easily serviced , but is also more conspicuous .
The pump impeller is driven by a long , vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump .
The submersible pump is entirely mounted inside the sump , and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits .
Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table -related problems in surface soil .
An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation .
As long as the pump functions , the surface soil will remain stable .
These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more ; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout .
They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in .
when was bloody kansas in
Bleeding Kansas , Bloody Kansas or the Border War , was a series of violent political confrontations involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery `` Border Ruffian `` elements , that took place in the Kansas Territory and the neighboring towns of Missouri between 1854 and 1861 .
At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the Union as a free state or slave state .
As such , Bleeding Kansas was a proxy war between Northerners and Southerners over the issue of slavery in the United States .
The term `` Bleeding Kansas '' was coined by Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune ; the events it encompasses directly presaged the American Civil War .
Congress had long struggled to balance the interests of pro-slavery forces and anti-slavery forces .
The events later known as Bleeding Kansas were set into motion by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 , which nullified the Missouri Compromise and instead implemented the concept of popular sovereignty .
An ostensibly democratic idea , popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state ; however , this resulted in immigration en masse to Kansas by activists from both sides .
At one point , Kansas had two separate governments , each with its own constitution , although only one was federally recognized .
On January 29 , 1861 , Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state , less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumter which began the Civil War .
What Is Benzene Used For
Benzene is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C6 H|Hydrogen|H6 .
Its molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring , with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom .
Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms , benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon .
Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil , and is one of the most basic petrochemicals .
Benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon and the second [ n ] - annulene ( [ 6 ] -annulene ) , a cyclic hydrocarbon with a continuous pi bond .
It is sometimes abbreviated Ph –H . Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell .
It is mainly used as a precursor to heavy chemicals , such as ethylbenzene and cumene , which are produced on a billion kilogram scale .
Because it has a high octane number , it is an important component of gasoline , composing a few percent of its mass .
Most non-industrial applications have been limited by benzene 's carcinogenicity .

what is homebrew for wii ?
Wii homebrew refers to the reuse of Nintendo 's Wii game console to run software that has not been authorized by Nintendo .
It achieves this by defeating the Wii 's copy protection and code signing measures .
In more general terms , Wii Homebrew refers to the use of the Wii 's hardware , accessories and software for purposes outside those intended by the manufacturer .
Original efforts focused on using the Wii Remote as a pointing device on other operating systems , or running web-based games in the built-in web browser .
Subsequent developments in games exploits , such as the `` Twilight hack `` , `` Bannerbomb '' and its later incarnation `` LetterBomb '' , `` Smash Stack '' , `` Indiana Pwns '' , `` Yu-Gi-OWNED '' , `` bathaxx '' , and `` Return of the Jodi '' , made installing the `` Homebrew Channel `` possible .

what is the name of an investigation with controlled variables
Take identical growing plants and give fertilizer to half of them .
If there are differences between the fertilized plant group and the unfertilized `` control '' group , these differences may be due to the fertilizer .
A scientific control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable .
This increases the reliability of the results , often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements .
Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method .
For example , during drug testing , scientists will try to control two groups to keep them as identical as possible , then allow one group to try the drug .
Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden : the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group , because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against .
Without a control group , the experiment can not determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated .
Ideally , all variables in an experiment will be controlled ( accounted for by the control measurements ) and none will be uncontrolled .
In such an experiment , if all the controls work as expected , it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested .
That is , scientific controls allow an investigator to make a claim like `` Two situations were identical until factor X occurred .
Since factor X is the only difference between the two situations , the new outcome was caused by factor X . ''

what was john adams doing to help france
John Adams ( October 30 , 1735 ( O.S . October 19 , 1735 ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was the second president of the United States ( 1797–1801 ) , having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States .
An American Founding Father , he was a statesman , diplomat , and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain .
Well educated , he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas , both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers .
Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution .
A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence .
He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , and was its primary advocate in the Congress .
Later , as a diplomat in Europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers .
A political theorist and historian , Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought .
One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States .
Adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .
During his one term , he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton .
Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war ( called the `` Quasi-War `` ) with France , 1798–1800 .
The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton 's opposition .
In 1800 , Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts .
He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson .
He and his wife , Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the Adams political family .
Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States .
His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times , though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders .
Adams was the first U.S. president to reside in the building that eventually became known as the White House .
what were the major obstacles facing the Industrial Revolution/
A Watt steam engine .
The steam engine , fuelled primarily by coal , propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world .
The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes that occurred in the period from about 1760 to some time between 1820 and 1840 .
This transition included going from hand production methods to machines , new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes , improved efficiency of water power , the increasing use of steam power and development of machine tools .
The transition also included the change from wood and other bio-fuels to coal .
The Industrial revolution began in Britain and within a few decades spread to Western Europe and the United States .
The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way .
Most notably , average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth .
In the words of Nobel Prize winner Robert E. Lucas , Jr. , `` For the first time in history , the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth ... Nothing remotely like this economic behavior is mentioned by the classical economists , even as a theoretical possibility . ''
William Bell Scott Iron and Coal , 1855-60
The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians .
Eric Hobsbawm held that it 'broke out ' in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s , while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 .
Some 20th-century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer .
This is still a subject of debate among historians .
GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy .
The Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies .
Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .
The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the increasing adoption of steam-powered boats , ships and railways , the large scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of steam powered factories .

what is the largest city by area in the us
This list ranks U.S. cities by land area ( not including bodies of water ) .
Total areas ( including water ) are also given , but note that , when ranked by total area , a number of coastal cities appear disproportionately `` larger '' .
San Francisco is an extreme example ; water makes up nearly 80 % of its total area of 232 square miles ( 601 km2 ) .
Note also that in many cases a city may be geographically large primarily because its municipal government has merged with the government of the surrounding county .
In some cases the county no longer exists , while in others the arrangement has formed a Consolidated city–county ( or city- borough in Alaska , or city- parish in Louisiana ) .
These are shown in bold in the list below ( but not all examples may be indicated ) .
** These are independent cities , meaning they are not a part of any county .
what is another name for the large intestine
The large intestine ( or bowel , colon ) is the last part of the digestive system in vertebrate animals .
Its function is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter , and then to pass useless waste material from the body .
This article is primarily about the human gut , though the information about its processes are directly applicable to most mammals .
The large intestine consists of the cecum , rectum and anal canal .
It starts in the right iliac region of the pelvis , just at or below the right waist , where it is joined to the bottom end of the small intestine .
From here it continues up the abdomen , then across the width of the abdominal cavity , and then it turns down , continuing to its endpoint at the anus .
The large intestine is about long , which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the intestinal canal .
In Terminologia Anatomica the large intestine includes the cecum , colon , rectum , and anal canal .
However , some sources exclude the anal canal .
where is green bay packers from
The Green Bay Packers are an American football team based in Green Bay , Wisconsin .

In 1919 and 1920 the Packers competed as a semi-professional football team against clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest .
They joined the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) in 1921 , the forerunner to what is known today as the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Although Green Bay is the last NFL `` small town '' team , its local fan base and media extends into nearby Milwaukee ; the team also played selected home games there between 1933 and 1994 .
The Green Bay Packers have won 13 league championships ( more than any other team in the NFL ) , including nine NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowl victories —in 1967 ( Super Bowl I ) , 1968 ( Super Bowl II ) , 1997 ( Super Bowl XXXI ) and 2011 ( Super Bowl XLV ) .
The Packers have long-standing , bitter rivalries with their NFC North ( formerly the NFC Central ) opponents , the Chicago Bears , Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions .

what is the highest mountain in america and where is is located ?
Mount McKinley ( also known as Denali taken from the Inuit Koyukon Athabaskan language meaning `` The Great One '' ) is the highest mountain peak in the United States and in North America with a summit elevation of above sea level .
At some , the base to peak rise is considered the largest of any mountain situated entirely above sea level .
Measured by topographic prominence , it is the third most prominent peak after Mount Everest and Aconcagua .
Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of US state of Alaska , it is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve .
The first European to document sighting the mountain was George Vancouver in 1794 .
In 1903 , James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing McKinley which was unsuccessful .
In 1906 , Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent which was later proven to be false .
The first verifiable ascent to McKinley 's summit was achieved on June 7 , 1913 by climbers Hudson Stuck , Harry Karstens , Walter Harper , and Robert Tatum .
In 1951 , Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route considered to be the safest and easiest route and therefore the most popular currently in use .
what was the first honda car
The Honda S600 is an automobile manufactured by Honda .
It was launched in March 1964 .
Available as a roadster – bearing strong resemblance to the Honda S500 – and as a fastback coupé – introduced in March 1965 – the S600 was the first Honda available in two trim levels .
During its production run up to 1966 , the model styling would remain pretty much the same , with the most notable changes coming to the front grille , bumper , and headlights .
Powered by a DOHC , water-cooled , four-cylinder inline engine with four carburetors , the engine capacity was increased to 606 cc from the S500 's 531 cc .
The engine produced at 8,500 rpm and had a top speed of .
With the convertible weighing in at mere , the extra sheet metal of the coupe only added to the overall weight .
Suspension was independent with sealed roller chain drive to each rear wheel .
The S600 was the first mass marketed Honda car .
First offered only in right-hand drive , it soon became available in left-hand drive to appeal to export markets .
There were a few pre-production S500s manufactured in left hand drive , two or three even being shown in some early sales brochures .
Both the S600 roadster and coupé were available in standard trim and a special , upgraded package called the SM600 which included , among other items , special paint colors , exclusive badging , a standard radio and speaker , a special antenna in the passenger side sun visor , standard reversing lights , a standard cigarette lighter , a standard heater , better cushioned seats , and a detachable seat track for quick removal of the passenger seat .
Honda built 3,912 roadsters in 1964 , with production climbing to 7,261 convertibles and 1,519 coupes in 1965 .
Production dropped off in 1966 ( as they were shifting to the S800 ) with only 111 roadsters and 281 coupes , giving tallies of 11,284 convertibles and 1,800 coupes for the 3 year span .

who is the writer of the beowulf poem ?
Beowulf ( ; in Old English or ) is the conventional title of an Old English heroic epic poem consisting of 3182 alliterative long lines , set in Scandinavia , commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature .
It survives in a single manuscript known as the Nowell Codex .
Its composition by an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet is dated between the 8th and the early 11th century .
In 1731 , the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through a building housing a collection of Medieval manuscripts assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton .
The poem fell into obscurity for decades , and its existence did not become widely known again until it was printed in 1815 in an edition prepared by the Icelandic-Danish scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin .
In the poem , Beowulf , a hero of the Geats in Scandinavia , comes to the help of Hroðgar , the king of the Danes , whose mead hall ( in Heorot ) has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel .
After Beowulf slays him , Grendel 's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated .
Victorious , Beowulf goes home to Geatland in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats .
After a period of fifty years has passed , Beowulf defeats a dragon , but is fatally wounded in the battle .
After his death , his attendants bury him in a tumulus , a burial mound , in Geatland .
who is shem in the bible
Shem Ham and Japheth by James Tissot 1904 .
Shem ( ; Sēm ; Arabic : Sām ; Ge'ez : ሴም , Sēm ; `` renown ; prosperity ; name '' ) was one of the sons of Noah in the Hebrew Bible as well as in Islamic literature .
He is most popularly regarded as the eldest son , though some traditions regard him as the second son .
Genesis 10:21 refers to relative ages of Shem and his brother Japheth , but with sufficient ambiguity to have yielded different translations .
The verse is translated in the KJV as `` Unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born . `` .
However , the New American Standard Bible gives , `` Also to Shem , the father of all the children of Eber , and the older brother of Japheth , children were born . ''
Genesis 11:10 records that Shem was still 100 years old at the birth of Arphaxad , ( but nearly 101 - see Chronology note , ) two years after the flood , making him barely 99 at the time the flood began ; and that he lived for another 500 years after this , making his age at death 600 years .
The children of Shem were Elam , Asshur , Arphaxad , Lud , and Aram , in addition to daughters .
Abraham , the patriarch of the Hebrews and Arabs , was one of the descendants of Arphaxad .
Islamic literature describes Shem as one of the believing sons of Noah .
Some sources even identify Shem as a prophet in his own right and that he was the next prophet after his father .
In one Muslim legend , Shem was one of the people that God made Jesus resurrect as a sign to the Children of Israel .
The 1st century historian Flavius Josephus , among many others , recounted the tradition that these five sons were the progenitors of the nations of Elam , Assyria , Chaldea , Lydia , and Syria , respectively .
Semitic is still a commonly used term for the Semitic languages , as a subset of the Afro-Asiatic languages , denoting the common linguistic heritage of Arabic , Aramaic , Akkadian , Ethiopic , Hebrew and Phoenician languages .
According to some Jewish traditions ( e.g. , B. Talmud Nedarim 32b ; Genesis Rabbah 46:7 ; Genesis Rabbah 56:10 ; Leviticus Rabbah 25:6 ; Numbers Rabbah 4:8 . ) , Shem is believed to have been Melchizedek , King of Salem whom Abraham is recorded to have met after the battle of the four kings .
In a few of the many extra-biblical sources that describe him , Shem is also credited with killing Nimrod , son of Cush .
Shem is mentioned in Genesis 5:32 , 6:10 ; 7:13 ; 9:18,23,26-27 ; 10 ; 11:10 ; also in 1 Chronicles 1:4 .

what is the minimalist trend
Minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design , especially visual art and music , where the work is set out to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms , features or concepts .
Minimalism is any design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect .
As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art , most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s .
Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd , John McCracken , Agnes Martin , Dan Flavin , Robert Morris , Anne Truitt , and Frank Stella .
It is rooted in the reductive aspects of Modernism , and is often interpreted as a reaction against Abstract expressionism and a bridge to Postminimal art practices .
The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music which features repetition and iteration , as in the compositions of La Monte Young , Terry Riley , Steve Reich , Philip Glass , and John Adams .
Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music .
The term `` minimalist '' is often applied colloquially to designate anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials .
It has also been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett , the films of Robert Bresson , the stories of Raymond Carver , and even the automobile designs of Colin Chapman .
The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe the Mensheviks .
What were the problems with Dalton 's original laws ?
In chemistry and physics , Dalton 's law ( also called Dalton 's law of partial pressures ) states that the total pressure exerted by the mixture of non-reactive gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases .
This empirical law was observed by John Dalton in 1801 and is related to the ideal gas laws .
Mathematically , the pressure of a mixture of gases can be defined as the summation
or
where represent the partial pressure of each component .
It is assumed that the gases do not react with each other
where is the mole fraction of the i-th component in the total mixture of n components .
The relationship below provides a way to determine the volume based concentration of any individual gaseous component
where is the concentration of the i-th component expressed in ppm .
Dalton 's law is not exactly followed by real gases .
Those deviations are considerably large at high pressures .
In such conditions , the volume occupied by the molecules can become significant compared to the free space between them .
In particular , the short average distances between molecules raises the intensity of intermolecular forces between gas molecules enough to substantially change the pressure exerted by them .
Neither of those effects are considered by the ideal gas model .

when was the american labor union formed
Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States .
Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages , benefits , and working conditions for their membership , and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions .
Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level .
Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations : the AFL-CIO created in 1955 , and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005 .
Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada , and take an active role in politics .
The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues .
In 2010 , the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States ( or total labor union `` density '' ) was 11.4 % , compared to 18.4 % in Germany , 27.5 % in Canada , and 70 % in Finland .
Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7 % — levels not seen since 1932 .
Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership .
The most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as teachers and police .
Members of unions are disproportionately older , male and residents of the Northeast , the Midwest , and California .
Union workers average 10-30 % higher pay than non-union in America after controlling for individual , job , and labor market characteristics .
Although much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s , American unions remain a prominent political factor , both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights , trade policy , health care , and living wage campaigns .
To fight alleged employer anti-union programs , unions are currently advocating new `` card check `` federal legislation that would require employers to bargain with a union if more than 50 % of workers signed forms , or `` cards , '' stating they wish to be represented by that union .
The current procedure involves waiting 45 to 90 days for a federally supervised secret-ballot employee referendum on the subject .
The economist Joseph Stiglitz has asserted that , `` Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality , whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs , sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape , to increase it . ''
The decline in unionization since WWII in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in income and wealth inequality .
what is boutique bank
A Christian Lacroix fashion boutique
A boutique is a small shopping outlet , especially one that specializes in elite and fashionable items such as clothing and jewelry .
The word is French for `` shop '' , via Latin from Greek ἀποθήκη ( apothēkē ) , `` storehouse '' .
The term entered into everyday English use in the late 1960s when , for a brief period , London was the centre of the fashion trade .
Carnaby Street and the Kings Road were the focus of much media attention as home to the most fashionable boutiques of the era .
Now the East of London has been regenerated and more Boutiques pop up in fashionable areas , such as Tower Bridge Road .
It can also refer to a specialised firm such as a boutique investment bank or boutique law firm .
The word is often used to describe a property in the independent section of the hotel market ( such as The Rockwell in London ) in order to distinguish themselves from larger chains ( such as Hilton Hotels ) .
In such cases the establishments aim to convey the idea that the operation is elite and highly specialised .
In the strictest sense of the word , boutiques would be one-of-a-kind but more generally speaking , some chains can be referred to as boutiques if they specialize in particular styles .
Recently , the term `` boutique '' has started being applied to normally-mass-market items that are either niche or produced in intentionally small numbers at very high prices .
This may be referred to as boutique manufacturing .
For example , before the release of the Wii , a Time Magazine article suggested that Nintendo could become a `` boutique video-game company '' , producing games for niche audiences , rather than trying to compete directly with Microsoft and Sony .
In the traditional luxury- watch industry Scalfaro International is considered as the precursor in manufacturing and sale of bespoke watches .
The Swiss company uses a highly flexible boutique manufacturing site , which allows producing small series or even unique timepieces .
Although some boutiques specialise in hand-made items and other truly one-of-a-kind items , others simply produce t-shirts , stickers , and other fashion accessories in artificially small runs and sell them at unusually high prices .
In the early 1990s Selena started manufacturing her own line of women 's clothing .
Opening two boutiques labeled as `` Selena Etc . Boutique & Salon '' One located in Corpus Christi and one located in San Antonio , Texas .
One was due to open in Monterrey , Mexico , in 1995 but due to her death it was not opened .
Around 1999 the San Antonio location closed and the Corpus Christi location was closed in 2009 .
In late 1990s some European retail traders developed the idea of tailoring a shop towards a lifestyle theme , in the form of `` concept stores '' , which specialised in cross-selling without using separate departments .
One of the first concept stores was 10 Corso Como in Milan , Italy followed by Colette in Paris and Quartier 206 in Berlin .
Several well-known American chains such as Urban Outfitters , D-A-S-H , and The Gap , Australian chain Billabong and , though less common , Lord & Taylor adapted to the concept store trend after 2000 .

what is definition of psychotic
Psychosis ( from the Greek ψυχή `` psyche '' , for mind/soul , and -ωσις `` -osis '' , for abnormal condition or derangement ) refers to an abnormal condition of the mind , and is a generic psychiatric term for a mental state often described as involving a `` loss of contact with reality `` .
People suffering from psychosis are described as psychotic .
Psychosis is given to the more severe forms of psychiatric disorder , during which hallucinations and delusions , gross excitement or stupor and impaired insight may occur .
The term `` psychosis '' is very broad and can mean anything from relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and catatonic expressions of schizophrenia and bipolar type 1 disorder .
Moreover a wide variety of central nervous system diseases , from both external substances and internal physiologic illness , can produce symptoms of psychosis .
This led many professionals to say that psychosis is not specific enough as a diagnostic term .
Despite this , `` psychosis '' is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior ( negative signs ) and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs ( e.g . grandiosity , delusions of persecution ) .
Someone exhibiting very obvious signs may be described as `` frankly psychotic '' , whereas one exhibiting very subtle signs could be classified in the category of an `` attenuated psychotic risk syndrome '' .
An excess in dopaminergic signalling is traditionally linked to the positive symptoms of psychosis , especially those of schizophrenia .
This is thought to occur through a mechanism of aberrant salience of environmental stimuli .
Many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system ; meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs , however , show either no significant difference between drug and placebo , or a very small effect size , suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system .
People experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder .
Depending on its severity , this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior , as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities .

what is BB statistics
Statistics play an important role in summarizing baseball performance and evaluating players in the sport .
Since the flow of a baseball game has natural breaks to it , and normally players act individually rather than performing in clusters , the sport lends itself to easy record-keeping and statistics .
Statistics have been kept for professional baseball since the creation of the National League and American League , now part of Major League Baseball .
Many statistics are also available from outside of Major League Baseball , from leagues such as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players and the Negro Leagues .
what were the disease like in the great depression ?

The unemployment rate in the US 1910–1960 , with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted .
The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding World War II .
The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations , but in most countries it started in 1930 and lasted until the late 1930s or middle 1940s .
It was the longest , most widespread , and deepest depression of the 20th century .
In the 21st century , the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world 's economy can decline .
The depression originated in the U.S. , after the fall in stock prices that began around September 4 , 1929 , and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29 , 1929 ( known as Black Tuesday ) .
The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries rich and poor .
Personal income , tax revenue , profits and prices dropped , while international trade plunged by more than 50 % .
Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25 % , and in some countries rose as high as 33 % .
Cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry .
Construction was virtually halted in many countries .
Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60 % .
Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs , areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping , mining and logging suffered the most .
Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s .
In many countries , the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the end of World War II .
what is an irregular heartbeat pvc
A premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) , also known as a premature ventricular complex , ventricular premature contraction ( or complex or complexes ) ( VPC ) , ventricular premature beat ( VPB ) , or ventricular extrasystole ( VES ) , is a relatively common event where the heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibres in the ventricles rather than by the sinoatrial node , the normal heartbeat initiator .
The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat .
A PVC may be perceived as a `` skipped beat `` or felt as palpitations in the chest .
In a normal heartbeat , the ventricles contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting ; in this way the ventricles can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body .
In a PVC , the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood , which means that circulation is inefficient .
However , single beat PVC arrhythmias do not usually pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in healthy individuals .
what is wrong with gary busey 's face
William Gary Busey ( born June 29 , 1944 ) , better known as Gary Busey , is an American film and stage actor , and artist .
He has appeared in a variety of films , including Lethal Weapon , Point Break , and Under Siege , as well as guest appearances on Gunsmoke , Walker , Texas Ranger , Law & Order , and Entourage .
He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1978 for his role in The Buddy Holly Story .
what is the truth in negotiations act act
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , is a multinational treaty for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement .
The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods , generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet , and would create a new governing body outside existing forums , such as the World Trade Organization , the World Intellectual Property Organization , or the United Nations .
The agreement was signed in October 2011 by Australia , Canada , Japan , Morocco , New Zealand , Singapore , South Korea , and the United States .
In 2012 , Mexico , the European Union and 22 countries which are member states of the European Union signed as well .
One signatory ( Japan ) has ratified ( formally approved ) the agreement , which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries .
Supporters have described the agreement as a response to `` the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works '' .
Trades Unions representing workers in the music , film and TV industries and large intellectual property-based organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America were active in the treaty 's development .
Opponents say the convention adversely affects fundamental rights including freedom of expression and privacy .
ACTA has also been criticised by Doctors Without Borders for endangering access to medicines in developing countries .
The secret nature of negotiations has excluded civil society groups , developing countries and the general public from the agreement 's negotiation process and it has been described as policy laundering by critics including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Entertainment Consumers Association .
The signature of the EU and many of its member states resulted in the resignation in protest of the European Parliament 's appointed chief investigator , rapporteur Kader Arif , as well as widespread protests across Europe .
In 2012 the newly-appointed rapporteur , British MEP David Martin , recommended against the treaty , stating : `` The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties '' .
On 4 July 2012 , the European Parliament rejected the agreement in plenary session , with 478 voting against the treaty , 39 in favour and 165 MEPs abstaining .
what is max gross weight for 2004 international semi truck
FAW semi-trailer truck in China
Tractor with side dump trailer semi-trailer
A tractor with an auto-transport semi-trailer .
Semi-trailer truck with sleeper behind the cab .
A semi-trailer truck is an articulated vehicle that consists of a towing engine , known as a tractor in the United States and truck in many other places , attached to one or more semi-trailers to carry freight .
It is also known as a transport in Canada , prime mover in Australia , semi , tractor-trailer , truck and trailer , transfer truck , 18-wheeler , mack truck , big rig in the United States , or artic , short for articulated lorry , in Britain and Ireland .
A semi-trailer does not trail completely behind the towing vehicle , but is attached at a point that is just forward of the rear-most axle of the towing unit .
This is done so that a fraction of the weight of the trailer is carried by the prime mover .
This arrangement means that both tractor and semi-trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid truck and trailer .
who was the quarterbacks in the super bowl between the steelers nd the cowboys
The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional football team based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
The team currently belongs to the North Division of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) in the National Football League ( NFL ) .
Founded in , the Steelers are the oldest franchise in the AFC .
Pittsburgh has won more Super Bowl titles ( six ) , won more AFC Championship Games ( eight ) and played in ( fifteen ) and hosted more ( eleven ) conference championship games than any other AFC or NFC team .
The Steelers share the record for most Super Bowl appearances with the Dallas Cowboys ( eight ) .
The Steelers won their most recent championship , Super Bowl XLIII , on February 1 , 2009 .
The Steelers were founded as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8 , 1933 , by Art Rooney , taking its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams to do at the time .
The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since its founding .
The current owner is Art 's son , Dan Rooney , who has given much control of the franchise to his son Art Rooney II .
Long one of the NFL 's flagship teams , the Steelers enjoy a large , widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation .
The Steelers currently play their home games at Heinz Field on Pittsburgh 's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood , which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers .
Built in 2001 , the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium which hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons .
Prior to Three Rivers , the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field .
what is flour made from
Three different kinds of wheat and rye flour
Flour is a powder which is made by grinding cereal grains , or other seeds or roots ( like Cassava ) .
It is the main ingredient of bread , which is a staple food for many cultures , making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history .
Wheat flour is one of the most important foods in European , North American , Middle Eastern , Indian and North African cultures , and is the defining ingredient in most of their styles of breads and pastries .
While wheat is the most common base for flour , corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times , and remains a staple throughout the Americas .
Rye flour is an important constituent of bread in much of central Europe , and rice can also be used in flour , though this is relatively uncommon .
what is my resting heart rate at age 24
Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time , typically expressed as beats per minute ( bpm ) .
Heart rate can vary as the body 's need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes , such as during physical exercise , sleep , illness , or as a result of ingesting drugs :
Central nervous system stimulants such as amphetamines increase heart rate .
Central nervous system depressants or sedatives decreases the heart rate ( apart from some particularly strange ones with equally strange effects , such as ketamine which can cause - amongst many other things - stimulant-like effects such as tachycardia ) .
There are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down .
Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain , many of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed ' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs .
Due to individuals having a constant blood volume , one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often .
Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm .
Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm .
However , heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention .
Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm , though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm , mainly if they are present during sleep , may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia ( see below ) .
what is the name for an old horse-drawn vehicle
Catherine II 's carved , painted and gilded Coronation Coach ( Hermitage Museum )
A carriage is a wheeled vehicle for people , usually horse-drawn ; litters ( palanquins ) and sedan chairs are excluded , since they are wheelless vehicles .
The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use and for comfort or elegance , though some are also used to transport goods .
It may be light , smart and fast or heavy , large and comfortable .
Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs , elliptical springs ( in the 19th century ) or leather strapping .
A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage – terms for such include stagecoach , charabanc and omnibus .
Working vehicles such as the ( four-wheeled ) wagon and ( two-wheeled ) cart share important parts of the history of the carriage , as is the fast ( two-wheeled ) chariot .
where was the tsunami in 2005
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on Sunday , 26 December 2004 , with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia .
The quake itself is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake .
The resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , South Asian tsunami , Indonesian tsunami , and the Boxing Day tsunami .
The earthquake was caused by subduction and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean , killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to high .
It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history .
Indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand .
With a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3 , it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph .
The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes .
It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska .
Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia .
The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response .
In all , the worldwide community donated more than $ 14 billion ( 2004 US $ ) in humanitarian aid .
what is the source of geothermal energy
Steam rising from the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland .
Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth .
Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter .
The Geothermal energy of the Earth 's crust originates from the original formation of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ) .
The geothermal gradient , which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface , drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface .
The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη ( ge ) , meaning earth , and θερμος ( thermos ) , meaning hot .
At the core of the Earth , thermal energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 °C ( 9,000 °F ) .
Heat conducts from the core to surrounding cooler rock .
The high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt , creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock .
The magma heats rock and water in the crust , sometimes up to 370 °C ( 700 °F ) .
From hot springs , geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times , but it is now better known for electricity generation .
Worldwide , about 10,715 megawatts ( MW ) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries .
An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating , space heating , spas , industrial processes , desalination and agricultural applications .
Geothermal power is cost effective , reliable , sustainable , and environmentally friendly , but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries .
Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources , especially for applications such as home heating , opening a potential for widespread exploitation .
Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth , but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels .
As a result , geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels .
The Earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity 's energy needs , but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited .
Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive .
Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology , energy prices , subsidies , and interest rates .
Pilot programs like EWEB 's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal .
But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience , the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the past two decades .
In 2001 , geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh .
what is cubic ft
The term cubic foot is an Imperial and US customary ( non- metric ) unit of volume , used in the United States and the United Kingdom .
It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot ( 0.3048 m ) in length .
To calculate cubic feet multiply length X width X height .
who was ho chi minh in vietnam war
Hồ Chí Minh ( Northern Vietnamese pronunciation : , Southern Vietnamese pronunciation : ) ; 19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969 ) , born Nguyễn Sinh Cung and also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành and Nguyễn Ái Quốc , was a Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader who was prime minister ( 1945–1955 ) and president ( 1945–1969 ) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) .
He was a key figure in the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 , as well as the People’s Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and the Việt Cộng ( NLF or VC ) during the Vietnam War .
He led the Việt Minh independence movement from 1941 onward , establishing the communist -ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ .
He officially stepped down from power in 1955 due to health problems , but remained a highly visible figurehead and inspiration for those Vietnamese fighting for his cause—a united , communist Vietnam—until his death .
After the war , Saigon , capital of the Republic of Vietnam , was renamed Hồ Chí Minh City .

what is the california sales taxes
Sales taxes in the United States are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services in the United States .
While no national general sales tax exists , the federal government levies several national selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods and services .
Furthermore , forty-five states , the District of Columbia , and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the sale or lease of most goods and some services , and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods or services .
States may also delegate to local governments the authority to impose additional general or selective sales taxes .
Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the applicable tax rate .
Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction and range from less than 1 % to over 10 % .
Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale .
Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase .
Unlike the value added tax , a sales tax is imposed only once , at the retail level .
However , in cases where items are sold at retail more than once , such as used cars , the sales tax can be charged on the same item indefinitely .
The definition of retail sales and what goods and services are taxable vary among the states .
Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods and services that are exempt from sales tax , or taxed at reduced rates .
The purchase of goods for further manufacture or for resale is uniformly exempt from sales tax .
Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery stores , prescription medications , and many agricultural supplies .
Sales taxes , including those imposed by local governments , are generally administered at the state level .
States imposing sales tax require retail sellers to collect tax from customers , file returns , and remit the tax to the state .
Procedural rules vary widely .
Sellers generally must collect tax from in-state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate .
Most states allow or require electronic remittance .
what is another name for cpu
A central processing unit ( CPU ) , also referred to as a central processor unit , is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical , logical , and input/output operations of the system .
The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s .
The form , design , and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history , but their fundamental operation remains much the same .
A computer can have more than one CPU ; this is called multiprocessing .
Some integrated circuits ( ICs ) can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip ; those ICs are called multi-core processors .
Two typical components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) , which performs arithmetic and logical operations , and the control unit ( CU ) , which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them , calling on the ALU when necessary .
Not all computational systems rely on a central processing unit .
An array processor or vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements , with no one unit considered the `` center '' .
In the distributed computing model , problems are solved by a distributed interconnected set of processors .
what is RFID equipment
RFID chip next to a grain of rice .
This chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates an external magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when queried by a reader device .
This small type is incorporated in consumer products , and implanted in pets , for identification purposes .
Radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data , for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects .
The tags contain electronically stored information .
Some tags are powered and read at short ranges ( a few meters ) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ) .
Others use a local power source such as a battery , or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field , and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves ( i.e. , electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies ) .
Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters .
Unlike a bar code , the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader , and may be embedded in the tracked object .
RFID tags are used in many industries .
An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line .
Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses .
Livestock and pets may have tags injected , allowing positive identification of the animal .
Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing , possessions , or even implanted within people , the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy concerns .
what is comp time in disd
Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours .
Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
by custom ( what is considered healthy or reasonable by society ) ,
by practices of a given trade or profession,
by legislation,
by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives .
Most nations have overtime labor laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours .
These laws may take into account other considerations than the humanitarian , such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive , or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy .
One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work .
Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law , particularly if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of labour .
Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate .
Overtime laws , attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from country to country and between different economic sectors .
What is the main disadvantage of using algorithms
Visualization of links between pages on a wiki using a force-directed layout .
Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically pleasing way .
Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible , by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes , based on their relative positions , and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy .
While graph drawing can be a difficult problem , force-directed algorithms , being physical simulations , usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity .
what is lost purchasing power
Purchasing power ( sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation ) is the amount of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency .
For example , if you had taken one dollar to a store in the 1950s , you would have been able to buy a greater number of items than you would today , indicating that you would have had a greater purchasing power in the 1950s .
Currency can be either a commodity money , like gold or silver , or fiat currency , or free-floating market-valued currency like US dollars .
As Adam Smith noted , having money gives one the ability to `` command '' others ' labor , so purchasing power to some extent is power over other people , to the extent that they are willing to trade their labor or goods for money or currency .
If one 's monetary income stays the same , but the price level increases , the purchasing power of that income falls .
Inflation does not always imply falling purchasing power of one 's money income since it may rise faster than the price level .
A higher real income means a higher purchasing power since real income refers to the income adjusted for inflation .
For a price index , its value in the base year is usually normalized to a value of 100 .
The purchasing power of a unit of currency , say a dollar , in a given year , expressed in dollars of the base year , is 100/P , where P is the price index in that year .
So , by definition the purchasing power of a dollar decreases as the price level rises .
The purchasing power in today 's money of an amount C of money , t years into the future , can be computed with the formula for the present value :
where in this case i is an assumed future annual inflation rate .
what is the primary language of South Korea
Education in South Korea is viewed as being crucial for success and competition is consequently very heated and fierce .
A central administration oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school .
Mathematics , science , Korean , English , and social studies are generally considered to be the most important subjects .
Normally physical education is not considered important as it is not recognised , by the generally academic elitist South Korean populace , as education and therefore many schools lack high-quality gymnasiums and varsity athletics .
South Korea was the first country in the world to provide high-speed internet access to all primary , junior , and high schools .
Although South Korean students often rank highly on international comparative assessments when compared to students of most Western education systems , the South Korean education system is criticised for emphasising too much upon passive learning and memorisation .
The South Korean education system is rather notably strict and overly structured as compared to its counterparts in most Western societies .
Also , the prevalence of non-school for-profit private institutes such as academies or cram-schools ( Hagwon [ 학원 ] ) , which too emphasise on passive memorisation , as opposed to conceptual understanding , in students are criticised as a major social problem .
who was charged with murder after the massacre at My lai
The My Lai Massacre ( , ; , , or ) was the Vietnam War mass murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam on March 16 , 1968 , by United States Army soldiers of `` Charlie '' Company of 1st Battalion , 20th Infantry Regiment , 11th Brigade of the Americal Division .
Victims included women , men , children , and infants .
Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies were later found to be mutilated and many women were allegedly raped prior to the killings .
While 26 U.S. soldiers were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions at Mỹ Lai , only Second Lieutenant William Calley , a platoon leader in Charlie Company , was convicted .
Found guilty of killing 22 villagers , he was originally given a life sentence , but only served three and a half years under house arrest .
The massacre took place in the hamlets of My Lai and My Khe of Son My village .
The event is also known as the Son My Massacre , especially in the Vietnamese state media .
The U.S. military codeword for the `` Viet Cong stronghold '' was `` Pinkville '' .
The incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in 1969 .
The massacre also increased domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War .
Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and protect the wounded were initially denounced by several U.S . Congressmen as traitors .
They received hate mail and death threats and found mutilated animals on their doorsteps .
The three were later widely praised and decorated by the Army for their heroic actions .
who were the hijackers in 9-11
The hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda , and 15 of the 19 were citizens of Saudi Arabia .
Others were from Egypt , Lebanon , and the UAE .
The hijackers were organized into four teams , each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with four `` muscle hijackers '' who were trained to help subdue the pilots , passengers , and crew .
The first hijackers to arrive in the United States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi , who settled in the San Diego area in January 2000 .
They were followed by three hijacker-pilots , Mohamed Atta , Marwan al-Shehhi , and Ziad Jarrah early in the summer of 2000 to undertake flight training in south Florida .
The fourth hijacker-pilot , Hani Hanjour , arrived in San Diego in December 2000 .
The rest of the `` muscle hijackers '' arrived in the spring and early summer of 2001 , just months before the September 11 attacks .
what was muhammad 's vision
Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim ( ) ( circa| 570 – circa| 8 June 632 ) , also transliterated as Muhammad ( ) , was a religious , political , and military leader from Mecca who unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam .
He is believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God .
Muhammad is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God for mankind .
Non-Muslims regard Muhammad as the founder of Islam .
Muslims consider him to be the restorer of an unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets .
Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca , he was orphaned at an early age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib .
He later worked mostly as a merchant , as well as a shepherd , and was first married by age 25 .
Being in the habit of periodically retreating to a cave in the surrounding mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer , he later reported that it was there , at age 40 , that he received his first revelation from God .
Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that `` God is One `` , that complete `` surrender '' to Him ( lit .
islām ) is the only way ( dīn ) acceptable to God , and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God , in the same vein as other Islamic prophets .
Muhammad gained few followers early on , and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes ; he and his followers were treated harshly .
To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in the year 622 .
This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , which is also known as the Hijri Calendar .
In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina .
After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes , his followers , who by then had grown to 10,000 , took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca .
He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and then sent his followers out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia .
In 632 , a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage , Muhammad fell ill and died .
By the time of his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam , and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity .
The revelations ( or Ayah , lit .
`` Signs [ of God ] '' ) — which Muhammad reported receiving until his death – form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the religion is based .
Besides the Quran , Muhammad 's life ( sira ) and traditions ( sunnah ) are also upheld by Muslims as the sources of sharia law .
They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence , adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned .
While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times were largely negative , appraisals in modern history have been far less so .
Who is the world 's oldest living person
This is a list of tables of the verified oldest people in the world in ordinal rank , such as oldest person or oldest man .
In these tables , a supercentenarian is considered 'verified ' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research , such as the Gerontology Research Group ( GRG ) or Guinness World Records .
The longest unambiguously documented human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France ( 1875–1997 ) , who died at age 122 years , 164 days .
She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13 .
This led to news media attention in 1985 , after Calment turned 110 .
Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment 's age , beyond any reasonable question , in the records of her native city , Arles , France .
More evidence of Calment 's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian ; her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world 's oldest people .
The longest undisputed lifespan for male supercentenarians is that of Jiroemon Kimura , who currently lives in Japan and is age as of .

what is metal music about
Heavy metal ( often referred to as metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and in the United States .
With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness .
Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and machismo .
The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics , a status common throughout the history of the genre .
In the mid-1970s Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed .
Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden followed in a similar vein .
Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads `` or `` headbangers `` .
During the 1980s , glam metal became a commercial force with groups like Mötley Crüe and Poison .
Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme , aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other styles of the most extreme subgenres of metal like death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena .
Since the mid-1990s , popular styles such as nu metal , which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop ; and metalcore , which blends extreme metal with hardcore punk , have further expanded the definition of the genre .
what is extreme right wing
The far-right ( also known as the extreme right ) refers to the highest degree of rightism in right-wing politics .
Far right politics involves support of strong or complete social hierarchy in society , and supports supremacy of certain individuals or groups deemed to be innately superior or preferable who are to be more valued than those deemed to be innately inferior or undesirable .
The far right 's advocacy of supremacism is based on what its adherents perceive as innate characteristics of people that can not be changed .
This stands as a point of difference with the centre-right 's attribution of behaviours , such as laziness or decadence , as the primary sources of social inequalities .
The centre right—unlike the far right—claims that people can end their behavioural inferiority through changing their habits and choices .
The original far right , which emerged in France after the French Revolution , refused to accept the French Republic and supported a counter-revolution to restore the French monarchy and aristocracy .
The far right is commonly associated with persons or groups who hold extreme nationalist , xenophobic , racist , religious fundamentalist or reactionary views .
The most extreme-right movements have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority .
what is the title of Hobbes main work
Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury ( 5 April 1588 – 4 December 1679 ) , in some older texts Thomas Hobbs of Malmsbury , was an English philosopher , best known today for his work on political philosophy .
His 1651 book Leviathan established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of social contract theory .
Hobbes was a champion of absolutism for the sovereign , but he also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural equality of all men ; the artificial character of the political order ( which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state ) ; the view that all legitimate political power must be `` representative '' and based on the consent of the people ; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid .
He was one of the founders of modern political philosophy .
His understanding of humans as being matter and motion , obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion , remains influential ; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation , and of political communities as being based upon a `` social contract `` remains one of the major topics of political philosophy .
In addition to political philosophy , Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields , including history , geometry , the physics of gases , theology , ethics , and general philosophy .
what is high emotional intelligence ?
Emotional intelligence ( EI ) is the ability to identify , assess , and control the emotions of oneself , of others , and of groups .
It can be divided into ability EI and trait EI .
Ability EI is usually measured using maximum performance tests and has stronger relationships with traditional intelligence , whereas trait EI is usually measured using self-report questionnaires and has stronger relationships with personality .
Criticisms have centered on whether EI is a real intelligence and whether it has incremental validity over IQ and the Big Five personality traits .
what is the role of heredity
Heredity is the passing of traits to offspring from its parents or ancestor .
This is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism .
Through heredity , variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve .
The study of heredity in biology is called genetics , which includes the field of epigenetics .
what is modified agi
For United States individual income tax , adjusted gross income ( AGI ) is total gross income minus specific reductions .
Taxable income is adjusted gross income minus allowances for personal exemptions and itemized deductions .
For most individual tax purposes , AGI is more relevant than gross income .
Gross income is sales price of goods or property , minus cost of the property sold , plus other income .
It includes wages , interest , dividends , business income , rental income , and all other types of income .
Adjusted gross income is gross income less deductions from a business or rental activity and 21 other specific items .
Several deductions ( e.g . medical expenses and miscellaneous itemized deductions ) are limited based on a percentage of AGI .
Certain phase outs , including those of lower tax rates and itemized deductions , are based on levels of AGI .
Many states base state income tax on AGI with certain deductions .

what is prefix phone number
A telephone prefix is the first set of digits of a telephone number ; in the North American Numbering Plan countries ( country code 1 ) , it is the first three digits of a seven-digit phone number .
In other countries both the prefix and the number may have different lengths .
It shows which exchange the remaining numbers refer to .
A full telephone number is usually made up of country code ( required for international calls only ) , area code ( required for calls between telephone areas ) , prefix , and subscriber number .
Some places restrict certain prefixes to fax numbers or cell phones only ; in other places such dedicated prefixes are not used .
As telephone technology advanced , the precise significance of the prefix became blurred in many places ; 485 in London , UK , was once the GULliver exchange , but now 44207485xxxx is just considered one of many number blocks served by the CLKEN Kentish Town exchange ; 4420770703xx is another .
what is metformin used for
Metformin ( BP , pronounced , ; originally sold as Glucophage ) is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class .
It is the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in particular , in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function .
Its use in gestational diabetes has been limited by safety concerns .
It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome , and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor .
Metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver .
Metformin is the only antidiabetic drug that has been conclusively shown to prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes .
It helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels , and is not associated with weight gain .
, metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines ( the other being glibenclamide ) .
When prescribed appropriately , metformin causes few adverse effects ( the most common is gastrointestinal upset ) and is associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia .
Lactic acidosis ( a buildup of lactate in the blood ) can be a serious concern in overdose and when it is prescribed to people with contraindications , but otherwise , there is no significant risk .
First synthesized and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s , metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to insulin and other antidiabetic drugs .
Interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people , and in 1957 , French physician Jean Sterne published the first clinical trial of metformin as a treatment for diabetes .
It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1958 , Canada in 1972 , and the United States in 1995 .
Metformin is now believed to be the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world ; in the United States alone , more than 48 million prescriptions were filled in 2010 for its generic formulations .
what is it like at mount rushmore ?
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore near Keystone , South Dakota , in the United States .
Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son , Lincoln Borglum , Mount Rushmore features sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln .
The entire memorial covers and is above sea level .
The tallest mountain in the region is Harney Peak ( ) .
South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region .
Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from environmentalists and Native American groups .
They settled on the Mount Rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure .
Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud and Buffalo Bill Cody but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus , and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain .
After securing federal funding , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 .
Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction .
Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .
The U.S. National Park Service took control of the memorial in 1933 , while it was still under construction , and has managed the memorial to the present day .
It attracts nearly three million people annually .

where are statutes formed
Statute of Grand Duchy of Lithuania , written in Polish
A statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority that governs a state , city , or county .
Typically , statutes command or prohibit something , or declare policy .
The word is often used to distinguish law made by legislative bodies from case law , decided by courts , and regulations issued by government agencies .
Statutes are sometimes referred to as legislation or `` black letter law . ''
As a source of law , statutes are considered primary authority ( as opposed to secondary authority ) .
Ideally all statutes must be in harmony with the fundamental law of the land ( constitutional ) .
This word is used in contradistinction to the common law .
Statutes acquire their force from the time of their passage , however unless otherwise provided .
Statutes are of several kinds ; namely , Public or private .
Declaratory or remedial .
Temporary or perpetual .
A temporary statute is one which is limited in its duration at the time of its enactment .
It continues in force until the time of its limitation has expired , unless sooner repealed .
A perpetual statute is one for the continuance of which there is no limited time , although it may not be expressly declared to be so .
If , however , a statute which did not itself contain any limitation is to be governed by another which is temporary only , the former will also be temporary and dependent upon the existence of the latter .
Before a statute becomes law in some countries , it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government , and finally published as part of a code .
In many countries , statutes are organized in topical arrangements ( or `` codified '' ) within publications called codes , such as the United States Code .
In many nations statutory law is distinguished from and subordinate to constitutional law .
where are the internal and external iliac arteries
The external iliac arteries are two major arteries which bifurcate off the common iliac arteries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis .
They proceed anterior and inferior along the medial border of the psoas major muscles .
They exit the pelvic girdle posterior and inferior to the inguinal ligament about one third laterally from the insertion point of the inguinal ligament on the pubic tubercle at which point they are referred to as the femoral arteries .
The external iliac artery is usually the artery used to attach the renal artery to the recipient of a kidney transplant .

what is peat moss good for growing ?
Sphagnum is a genus of between 1510 and 3500 species of mosses , commonly called peat moss due to its prevalence in wet habitats where it contributes to the formation of peat bogs and mires .
Sphagnum accumulations can store water , since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells ; plants may hold from 16-26 times as much water as their dry weight depending on the species .
The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions .
Hence , as sphagnum moss grows , it can slowly spread into drier conditions , forming larger peatlands , both raised bogs and blanket bogs .
These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants , including sedges and ericaceous shrubs , as well as orchids and carnivorous plants .
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss 's cell walls .
In addition , bogs , like all wetlands , develop anaerobic soil conditions , which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action .
Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations , such as calcium and magnesium , and releasing hydrogen ions .
Under the right conditions , peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters .
Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH , so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species .
Individual peat moss plants consist of a main stem , with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches .
The top of the plant , or capitulum , has compact clusters of young branches .
Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes , named stem leaves ; the shape varies according to species .
The leaves consist of two kinds of cells ; small , green , living cells ( chlorophyllose cells ) , and large , clear , structural , dead cells ( hyaline cells ) .
The latter have the large water-holding capacity .
what is Network Interface Card ( NIC )
The earliest version of the Network Card , issued manually rather than through an APTIS machine .
The first APTIS version of the Network Card .
This was used from the start of the APTIS era in 1986/1987 until well into the 1990s , as stocks had to be used up despite the introduction of the new-look orange-banded version in 1991 .
The introduction of the weekday minimum fare condition in 2002 resulted in a minor change : the red `` R '' shows that this is the `` Revised '' version of the railcard .
This version is still in use as of 2007 .
The Network Railcard is a discount card introduced in 1986 by British Rail , upon the creation of their Network SouthEast area around London , England .
The card is intended to encourage leisure travel by rail by offering discounts for adults and accompanying children on a wide range of off-peak fares .
The range of discounts available , and the price of the card , have varied since that time , but the card has always been valid for a year 's unlimited use .
It can be purchased by any person aged 16 or over from any staffed National Rail station or Rail Appointed Travel Agent , by completing an application form - no photographic identification or other documentation is needed to buy or use the card .
It is one of a number of concessionary fare schemes available on the British railway system .

South Beach , also nicknamed SoBe , is a neighborhood in the city of Miami Beach , Florida , United States , located due east of Miami city proper between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean .
The area encompasses all of the barrier islands of Miami Beach south of Indian Creek .
This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed , starting in the 1910s , thanks to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher , the Lummus Brothers , and John S. Collins , the latter whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches .
The area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years , including a booming regional economy , increased tourism , and the 1926 hurricane , which destroyed much of the area .
As of 2010 , about 39,186 residents live in South Beach .
who was john f kennedy up against
The United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1960 .
The Republican Party nominated incumbent Vice-President Richard Nixon , while the Democratic Party nominated John F. Kennedy , Senator from Massachusetts .
The incumbent President , Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower , was not eligible for re-election after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the Twenty-second Amendment .
Kennedy was elected with a lead of 112,827 votes , or 0.17 % of the popular vote , giving him a victory of 303 to 219 in the Electoral College , the closest since 1916 .
This was the first election in which all fifty of the current United States participated .
A number of factors explain why the election was so close .
Kennedy gained since there was an economic recession which hurt the incumbent Republican , and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans .
Furthermore , the new votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among Protestants .
Kennedy 's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon 's .
In the end , Nixon 's emphasis on his experience carried little weight , and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states .
Kennedy used his large , well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination , secure endorsements , and , with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses , to get out the vote in the big cities .
He relied on running mate Lyndon B. Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively .
This election is notable as being the first time in U.S. history that two sitting U.S . Senators ( Kennedy and Johnson ) were elected as president and vice-president , a phenomenon that has been repeated once , by Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008 ( in both cases , the president was the younger , more junior senator ) .
who was the king during macbeth 's time
A poster for a c. 1884 American production of Macbeth , starring Thomas W. Keene .
Depicted , counter clockwise from top-left , are : Macbeth and Banquo meet the witches ; just after the murder of Duncan ; Banquo 's ghost ; Macbeth duels Macduff ; and Macbeth .
Macbeth is a play written by William Shakespeare .
It is considered one of his darkest and most powerful tragedies .
Set in Scotland , the play dramatizes the corroding psychological and political effects produced when its protagonist , the Scottish lord Macbeth , chooses evil as the way to fulfill his ambition for power .
He commits regicide to become king and then furthers his moral descent with a reign of murderous terror to stay in power , eventually plunging the country into civil war .
In the end , he loses everything that gives meaning and purpose to his life before losing his life itself .
The play is believed to have been written between 1603 and 1607 , and is most commonly dated 1606 .
The earliest account of a performance of what was probably Shakespeare 's play is April 1611 , when Simon Forman recorded seeing such a play at the Globe Theatre .
It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book .
It was most likely written during the reign of James I , who had been James VI of Scotland before he succeeded to the English throne in 1603 .
James was a patron of Shakespeare’s acting company , and of all the plays Shakespeare wrote during James’s reign , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright’s relationship with the sovereign .
Macbeth is Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy , and tells the story of a brave Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland .
Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the throne for himself .
His reign is racked with guilt and paranoia , and he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler as he is forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion .
The bloodbath swiftly takes Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into realms of arrogance , madness , and death .
Shakespeare 's source for the tragedy is the account of King Macbeth of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth .
In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as `` the Scottish play `` .
Over the course of many centuries , the play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth .
It has been adapted to film , television , opera , novels , comic books , and other media .

what is the controlled substance act known as
The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 .
The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture , importation , possession , use and distribution of certain substances is regulated .
The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs .
The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ) , with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each .
Two federal agencies , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration , determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules , though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing , and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000 , which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate in Schedule I . Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse ( an undefined term ) , currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , and international treaties .
What is the third theory of language acquisition .
Second-language acquisition or second-language learning is the process by which people learn a second language .
Second-language acquisition ( often abbreviated to SLA ) also refers to the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process .
Second language refers to any language learned in addition to a person 's first language ; although the concept is named second-language acquisition , it can also incorporate the learning of third , fourth , or subsequent languages .
Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do ; it does not refer to practices in language teaching .
The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics .
It is broad-based and relatively new .
As well as the various branches of linguistics , second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology , cognitive psychology , and education .
To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself , the terms second-language acquisition research , second-language studies , and second-language acquisition studies are also used .
SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field , and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date .
However , it does appear to have developed a great deal since the mid-1960s .
The term acquisition was originally used to emphasize the subconscious nature of the learning process , but in recent years learning and acquisition have become largely synonymous .
Second-language acquisition can incorporate heritage language learning , but it does not usually incorporate bilingualism .
Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language , not the process itself , and see the term as referring to native-like fluency .
Writers in fields such as education and psychology , however , often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of multilingualism .
Second-language acquisition is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a foreign language ; rather , the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations..
There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned , and many issues are still unresolved .
There are many theories of second-language acquisition , but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers .
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of second-language acquisition , this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future .

who was director of secret service in 1963
The United States Secret Service is a U.S. federal law enforcement agency that is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security .
The sworn members are divided among the Special Agents and the Uniformed Division .
Until March 1 , 2003 , the Service was part of the United States Department of the Treasury .
The U.S. Secret Service has two distinct areas of responsibility:
Financial Crimes , covering missions such as prevention and investigation of counterfeiting of U.S. currency and U.S. treasury securities , and investigation of major fraud .
Protection , which entails ensuring the safety of current and former national leaders and their families , such as the President , past presidents , vice presidents , presidential candidates , visiting heads of state , and foreign embassies ( per an agreement with the U.S. State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security ( DS ) Office of Foreign Missions ( OFM ) , etc . )
The Secret Service 's initial responsibility was to investigate counterfeiting of U.S. currency , which was rampant following the U.S. Civil War .
The agency then evolved into the United States ' first domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency .
Many of the agency 's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , and Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .

when was fdr elected as president
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( or ; January 30 , 1882 – April 12 , 1945 ) , also known by his initials , FDR , was the 32nd President of the United States ( 1933–1945 ) and a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century , leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war .
A dominant leader of the Democratic Party and the only American president elected to more than two terms , he built a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932 , as his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century .
With the bouncy popular song `` Happy Days Are Here Again `` as his campaign theme , FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932 , at the depth of the Great Depression .
Energized by his personal victory over polio , FDR 's unfailing optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit .
He worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II , and restoring prosperity to the nation 's economy .
In his first hundred days in office , which began March 4 , 1933 , Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal —a variety of programs designed to produce relief ( government jobs for the unemployed ) , recovery ( economic growth ) , and reform ( through regulation of Wall Street , banks and transportation ) .
The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , but then relapsed into a deep recession .
The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court or passing any considerable legislation ; it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment diminished during World War II .
Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85 , except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which still exists .
Along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which was created in 1933 , and Social Security , which Congress passed in 1935 .
As World War II loomed after 1938 , with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain , while remaining officially neutral .
His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` which would supply munitions to the Allies .
In March 1941 , Roosevelt , with Congressional approval , provided Lend-Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain .
With very strong national support , he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , calling it a `` date which will live in infamy `` .
He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the Allied war effort .
As an active military leader , Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world 's first atom bomb .
In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians .
Unemployment dropped to 2 % , relief programs largely ended , and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers , and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service .
Roosevelt dominated the American political scene not only during the twelve years of his presidency , but also for decades afterward .
He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System .
FDR 's New Deal Coalition united labor unions , big city machines , white ethnics , African Americans and rural white Southerners .
He also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods .
Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents , along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington .
A liberal Democrat , Roosevelt defined his ideological position as `` a little left of center . ''
where was ms-13 originally from
Mara Salvatrucha ( commonly abbreviated as MS , Mara , and MS-13 ) is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles and has spread to other parts of the United States , Canada , Mexico , and Central America .
The majority of the gang is ethnically composed of Central Americans and active in urban and suburban areas .
In the U.S. , the MS-13 has an especially heavy presence in Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California ; the Washington , D.C. metropolitan areas of Fairfax County , Virginia , Montgomery County , Maryland , and Prince George 's County , Maryland ; Long Island , New York ; the Boston , Massachusetts area ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; and Houston , Texas .
There is also a presence of MS-13 in Toronto , Ontario , Canada .
Members of MS distinguish themselves by tattoos covering the body and also often the face , as well as the use of their own sign language .
They are notorious for their use of violence and a subcultural moral code that predominantly consists of merciless revenge and cruel retributions .
This cruelty of the distinguished members of the `` Maras '' or `` Mareros '' earned them a path to be recruited by the Sinaloa Cartel battling against Los Zetas in an ongoing drug war south of the United States border .
Their wide-ranging activities have drawn the attention of the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , who have initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members – netting hundreds of arrests across the country .

where was the super bowl in 1991
Super Bowl XXV was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Buffalo Bills and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion New York Giants to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 1990 season .
The Giants defeated the Bills by the score of 20–19 , winning their second ever Super Bowl .
It is the only Super Bowl decided by one point .
The game was held at Tampa Stadium in Tampa , Florida , on January 27 , 1991 , during the height of the Gulf War .
It was thus played under much patriotic fervor .
The proceedings included a rousing rendition of `` The Star-Spangled Banner `` by Whitney Houston during the pregame ceremonies .
The Bills and their explosive no-huddle offense were making their first Super Bowl appearance after finishing the regular season with a 13-3 record , and leading the league in total points scored with 428 .
In advancing to their second Super Bowl , the Giants also posted a 13-3 regular season record , but with a ball-control offense and a defense that allowed a league low 211 points .
The game is best remembered for Bills placekicker Scott Norwood 's last-second field goal attempt which went wide right of the uprights , leading to a Giants victory , and starting a four-game losing streak in the Super Bowl for the Bills .
The Giants set a Super Bowl record holding possession of the ball for 40 minutes and 33 seconds .
New York also overcame a 12-3 second-quarter deficit , and made a 75-yard touchdown drive that consumed a Super Bowl record 9:29 off the clock .
Giants running back Ottis Anderson , who carried the ball 21 times for 102 yards and one touchdown , was named Super Bowl MVP .
He was the first awardee to receive the newly named `` Pete Rozelle Trophy '' ( named for the former commissioner ) .
Anderson also recorded one reception for seven yards .
when was malcolm x assassinated
Malcolm X ( ; May 19 , 1925February 21 , 1965 ) , born Malcolm Little and also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz ( ) , was an African-American Muslim minister and human rights activist .
To his admirers , he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks , a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans .
Detractors accused him of preaching racism , black supremacy , and violence .
He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history .
Malcolm X 's father died—killed by white supremacists , it was rumored—when he was young , and at least one of his uncles was lynched .
When he was 13 , his mother was placed in a mental hospital , and he was placed in a series of foster homes .
In 1946 , at age 20 , he went to prison for breaking and entering .
In prison , Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam ; after his parole in 1952 , he quickly rose to become one of its leaders .
For a dozen years , Malcolm X was the public face of the controversial group , but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964 .
After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East , he returned to the United States , where he founded Muslim Mosque , Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity .
In February 1965 , less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam , he was assassinated by three members of the group .
Malcolm X 's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time .
As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught black supremacy and advocated separation of black and white Americans —in contrast to the civil rights movement 's emphasis on integration .
After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964—saying of his association with it , `` I did many things as a [ Black ] Muslim that I 'm sorry for now .
I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march '' —and becoming a Sunni Muslim , he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders , he continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism , black self-determination , and self-defense .

The 2010 United States Senate election in Florida took place on November 2 , 2010 along with other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as all elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections .
Republican Marco Rubio , former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives , defeated independent Charlie Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek in a three-way race .
One term Senator Mel Martinez was elected in a very close race against Democrat Betty Castor in 2004 with 49 % of the vote .
Martinez announced on December 2 , 2008 that he would not seek re-election to the Senate , and would resign prior to the end of his term .
In August 2009 , Governor Charlie Crist announced that he would appoint his former Chief of Staff , George LeMieux , a Republican , to the Senate seat being vacated by Martinez .
Governor Crist publicly announced he was running for the seat in mid-2009 .
At the time he received many Republican endorsements , such as the National Republican Senatorial Committee , Martinez , and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
His support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives , and candidate Marco Rubio surged .
In April 2010 Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an independent .
The National Republican Senatorial Committee withdrew its endorsement of Crist and demanded a refund of its campaign funds that it provided for the Crist campaign .
Congressman Kendrick Meek was the first Democrat to declare his intention to run .

what is lean manufacturing and who developed
Lean manufacturing , lean enterprise , or lean production , often simply , `` Lean , '' is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful , and thus a target for elimination .
Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service , `` value '' is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for .
Essentially , lean is centered on preserving value with less work .
Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System ( TPS ) ( hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent ) and identified as `` Lean '' only in the 1990s .
TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value , but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved .
The steady growth of Toyota , from a small company to the world 's largest automaker , has focused attention on how it has achieved this success .

what is vitamin a for
Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons , which include retinol , retinal , retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important .
Vitamin A has multiple functions , it is important for growth and development , for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision .
Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule , that is necessary for both low-light ( scotopic vision ) and color vision .
Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells .
In foods of animal origin , the major form of vitamin A is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol ( chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine .
The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin , and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form , retinal .
The associated acid ( retinoic acid ) , a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A , has only partial vitamin A activity , and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle .
Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation .
All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached , called a retinyl group .
Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity .
The orange pigment of carrots – beta-carotene – can be represented as two connected retinyl groups , which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels .
Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group , which give them some vitamin activity .
None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity .
The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans .
Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods :
Retinol , the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources , is a yellow , fat-soluble substance .
Since the pure alcohol form is unstable , the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester .
It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate .
The carotenes alpha-carotene , beta-carotene , gamma-carotene ; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin ( all of which contain beta-ionone rings ) , but no other carotenoids , function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals , which possess the enzyme ( 15-15'-dioxygenase ) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol .
In general , carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids , and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and can not convert any carotenoids to retinal ( resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species ) .

With an estimated 2011 population of 477,891 , it is the sixth-largest city in California and the 35th largest city in the United States .
Sacramento is the core cultural and economic center of the Sacramento metropolitan area which includes seven counties with an estimated 2009 population of 2,527,123 .
Its metropolitan area is the fourth largest in California after the Greater Los Angeles Area , San Francisco Bay Area , and the San Diego metropolitan area , as well as the 25th largest in the United States .
Sacramento was cited by Time magazine as America 's most ethnically and racially integrated city in 2002 .
Sacramento became a city through the efforts of the Swiss immigrant John Sutter , Sr. , his son John Sutter , Jr. , and James W. Marshall .
Sacramento grew quickly thanks to the protection of Sutter 's Fort , which was established by Sutter in 1839 .
During the California Gold Rush , Sacramento was a major distribution point , a commercial and agricultural center , and a terminus for wagon trains , stagecoaches , riverboats , the telegraph , the Pony Express , and the First Transcontinental Railroad .
California State University , Sacramento , more commonly known as Sacramento State or Sac State , is the largest local university .

when is it memorial day
Memorial Day is a United States federal holiday which occurs every year on the final Monday of May .
Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces .
Formerly known as Decoration Day , it originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War .
By the 20th century Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died in all wars .
It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season , while Labor Day marks its end .
Many people visit cemeteries and memorials , particularly to honor those who have died in military service .
Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries .
By the early 20th century , Memorial Day was an occasion for more general expressions of memory , as people visited the graves of their deceased relatives in church cemeteries , whether they had served in the military or not .
It also became a long weekend increasingly devoted to shopping , family gatherings , fireworks , trips to the beach , and national media events .
Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South , notably in the mountains .
In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried , this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles .
People gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with kinfolk and others .
There often is a religious service and a `` dinner on the ground , '' the traditional term for a potluck meal in which people used to spread the dishes out on sheets or tablecloths on the grass .
It is believed that this practice began before the American Civil War and thus may reflect the real origin of the `` memorial day '' idea .
Memorial Day is not to be confused with Veterans Day ; Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving , while Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans , living or dead .
What was `` Freedom Summer '' ?
Mt . Zion Church state history marker near Philadelphia , Mississippi .
Freedom Summer ( also known as the Mississippi Summer Project ) was a campaign in the United States launched in June 1964 to attempt to register as many African American voters as possible in Mississippi , which had historically excluded most blacks from voting .
The project also set up dozens of Freedom Schools , Freedom Houses , and community centers in small towns throughout Mississippi to aid the local black population .
The project was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations ( COFO ) , a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations ( SNCC , CORE , NAACP and SCLC ) .
Most of the impetus , leadership , and financing for the Summer Project came from the SNCC .
Robert Parris Moses , SNCC field secretary and co-director of COFO , directed the summer project .
What is the cultural background of blues
Blues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre that originated in communities of primarily the `` Deep South `` of the United States around the end of the 19th century from spirituals , work songs , field hollers , shouts and chants , and rhymed simple narrative ballads .
The blues form , ubiquitous in jazz , rhythm and blues , and rock and roll is characterized by specific chord progressions , of which the twelve-bar blues chord progression is the most common .
The blue notes that , for expressive purposes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent ( minor 3rd to major 3rd ) in relation to the pitch of the major scale , are also an important part of the sound .
The blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics , bass lines , and instruments .
Blues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century .
Best known are the Delta , Piedmont , Jump , and Chicago blues styles .
World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience , especially white listeners .
In the 1960s and 1970s , a hybrid form called blues-rock evolved .
The term `` the blues '' refers to the `` blue devils '' , meaning melancholy and sadness ; an early use of the term in this sense is found in George Colman 's one-act farce Blue Devils ( 1798 ) .
Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older , it has been attested to since 1912 , when Hart Wand 's `` Dallas Blues `` became the first copyrighted blues composition .
In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood .
who is on the quarter
A quarter dollar , commonly shortened to quarter , is a coin worth 1⁄4 of a United States dollar or 25 cents .
The quarter has been produced since 1796 .
The choice of 25¢ as a denomination , as opposed to 20¢ which is more common in other parts of the world , originated with the practice of dividing Spanish Milled Dollars into eight wedge shaped segments ( cf. `` pieces of eight `` ) .
At one time `` two bits `` , i.e . two wedges , each wedge an eighth , thus a quarter of the Spanish real , was a common nickname for a quarter .
where is dia de los muertos celebrated
Day of the Dead ( ) is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico and around the world in other cultures .
The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died .
It is particularly celebrated in Mexico , where it is a national holiday , and all banks are closed .
The celebration takes place on November 1 and 2 , in connection with the Catholic holidays of All Saints ' Day and All Souls ' Day .
Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars honoring the deceased using sugar skulls , marigolds , and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed and visiting graves with these as gifts .
They also leave possessions of the deceased .
Scholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl .
The holiday has spread throughout the world : In Brazil , Dia de Finados is a public holiday that many Brazilians celebrate by visiting cemeteries and churches .
In Spain , there are festivals and parades , and , at the end of the day , people gather at cemeteries and pray for their dead loved ones .
Similar observances occur elsewhere in Europe , and similarly themed celebrations appear in many Asian and African cultures .

when was washington elected president
George Washington ( – , 1799 ) was the first President of the United States ( 1789–1797 ) , the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States .
He presided over the convention that drafted the Constitution , which replaced the Articles of Confederation and established the position of President .
Washington was elected President as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors in 1788 , and he served two terms in office .
He oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in Europe , suppressed rebellion , and won acceptance among Americans of all types .
His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since , such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address .
Further , the peaceful transition from his presidency to the presidency of John Adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st century .
Washington was hailed as `` father of his country `` even during his lifetime .
Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia ; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves .
After both his father and older brother died when he was young , Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax , who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier .
Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War .
Chosen by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution , Washington managed to force the British out of Boston in 1776 , but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City .
After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter , he defeated the British in two battles , retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause .
Because of his strategy , Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781 .
Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals , encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army , coordination with the state governors and state militia units , relations with Congress and attention to supplies , logistics , and training .
In battle , however , Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies .
After victory had been finalized in 1783 , Washington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism .
Dissatisfied with the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation , in 1787 Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the United States Constitution .
Elected unanimously as the first President of the United States in 1789 , he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation .
He supported Alexander Hamilton 's programs to pay off all state and national debt , to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank ( despite opposition from Thomas Jefferson ) .
Washington proclaimed the United States neutral in the wars raging in Europe after 1793 .
He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians .
Although never officially joining the Federalist Party , he supported its programs .
Washington 's Farewell Address was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars .
He retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home , Mount Vernon , and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises .
He freed all his slaves by his final will .
Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power .
He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty , improve infrastructure , open the western lands , promote commerce , found a permanent capital , reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism .
At his death , Washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by Henry Lee .
The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years , the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument .
As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history , Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism , especially in France and Latin America .
what is the annual budget of medicare
Fiscal Year 2012 U.S. Federal Spending – Cash or Budget Basis .
Fiscal Year 2012 U.S. Federal Receipts .
The Budget of the United States Government often begins as the President 's proposal to the U.S. Congress which recommends funding levels for the next fiscal year , beginning October 1 .
However , Congress is the body required by law to pass a budget annually and to submit the budget passed by both houses to the President for signature .
Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the federal budget process .
Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees , which then approve individual appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs .
If Congress fails to pass an annual budget ( as has been the case since 2009 ) , a series of Appropriations bills must be passed as `` stop gap '' measures .
After Congress approves an appropriations bill , it is sent to the President , who may sign it into law , or may veto it ( as he would a budget when passed by the Congress ) .
A vetoed bill is sent back to Congress , which can pass it into law with a two-thirds majority in each chamber .
Congress may also combine all or some appropriations bills into an omnibus reconciliation bill .
In addition , the president may request and the Congress may pass supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental appropriations bills .
Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis .
These include the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congressional Budget Office , the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) and the U.S. Treasury Department .
These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges .
In the short-run , tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe recession and tax policy choices , while expenditures have expanded for wars , unemployment insurance and other safety net spending .
In the long-run , expenditures related to healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are projected to grow faster than the economy overall as the population matures .
where is the island New Guinea ?
New Guinea ( also , Tok Pisin : Niugini , Dutch : Nieuw Guinea , and ; historically : Papua ) is the world 's second largest island , after Greenland , covering a land area of 786,000 km2 .
Located in the southwest Pacific Ocean , it lies geographically to the east of the Malay Archipelago , with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago .
Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia .
When world sea levels were low , the two shared shorelines ( which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level ) , combining with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul , also known as Greater Australia .
The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period .
Anthropologically , New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia .
Politically , the western half of the island comprises two Indonesian provinces : Papua and West Papua .
The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea .
The island has a population of about 7.5 million , with a very low population density of only 8 inh/km2 .
New Guinea is differentiated from its drier , flatter , and less fertile southern counterpart , Australia , by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology , with its highest point , Puncak Jaya , reaching an elevation of 4,884 m ( 16,023 ft ) .
Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna , with marsupials , including wallabies and possums , and the egg-laying monotreme , the spiny anteater , or echidna .
Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera , there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals .
Pigs , several additional species of rats , and the ancestor of the New Guinea Singing Dog were introduced with human colonization .
The human presence on the island dates back at least 40,000 years to the oldest human migrations out of Africa .
Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture , with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years .
Because of the time depth of its inhabitation and its highly fractured landscape , an unusually high number of languages are spoken on the island , with some 1,000 languages ( a figure higher than that of most continents ) having been catalogued out of an estimated world-wide pre-Columbian total of 6,000 human dialects .
Most are classified as Papuan languages , a generally accepted geographical term which a minority of authors hold to be a genetic one .
A number of Austronesian languages are spoken on the coast and on offshore islands .
In the 16th century Spanish explorers discovered the island and called it Nueva Guinea .
In recent history western New Guinea was included in the Dutch East Indies colony .
The Germans annexed the northern coast of the eastern half of the island as German New Guinea in their pre–World War I effort to establish themselves as a colonial power , whilst the south eastern portion was reluctantly claimed by Britain .
Following the Treaty of Versailles , the German portion was awarded to Australia ( which was already governing the British claim , named the Territory of Papua ) as a League of Nations mandate .
The eastern half of the island was granted independence from Australia as Papua New Guinea in 1975 .
The western half gained independence from the Dutch in 1961 , but became part of Indonesia soon afterwards in controversial circumstances .

what is bevo in text terms
Bevo sign
Bevo was a non-alcoholic malt beverage , or near beer , brewed in the United States by the Anheuser-Busch company beginning in the early 20th century .
Bevo enjoyed its greatest success during the time of prohibition , when beer , wine and distilled liquors , were made illegal for thirteen years .
The Anheuser-Busch company started brewing Bevo when alcoholic beverages were prohibited in 1916 by the United States armed forces .
Production rose greatly with national prohibition in 1919 , and Bevo was by far the most popular of the many `` cereal beverages '' or `` near beers '' of the time .
At the peak of its popularity in the early 1920s , more than five million cases of Bevo were sold annually .
Renard with a mug of Bevo , depicted in terra cotta on the interior walls of the Bevo building , St. Louis
Labels on the bottles billed it as `` Bevo the Beverage '' .
The name `` Bevo '' was coined from the word `` beverage '' and the Slavic language word for beer `` pivo '' , and was pronounced `` Bee-vo '' .
Some Bevo advertising featured the character `` Renard the Fox `` ( based on the protagonist of a medieval French folk-tale ) , and promotional mugs with this character were manufactured .
In 1930 Anheuser-Busch built a series of boat-bodied cars in its St. Louis shops called the `` Bevo Boats '' which were used for promotion .
Seven are believed to have been built on Pierce-Arrow 8-cylinder chassis while one surviving example was based upon 1930 Cadillac 353 V8 .
Billboard advertising Bevo in Trenton , New Jersey , 1917
A contemporary advertisement read `` Cooling and invigorating , Bevo the Beverage .
Order by the case from your grocer , druggist , or dealer . ''
The paper label on the back of the bottle read `` The All-Year-Round Soft Drink .
Appetizing - Healthful - Nutritious - Refreshing .
Milk or water may contain bacteria .
BEVO never does . ''
Bevo became part of the popular culture of the time , and is mentioned in various popular songs and Vaudeville skits of the era .
This led to secondary slang uses of the word ; for example , in American military slang a young and inexperienced officer was called a `` Bevo '' .
The University of Texas named its mascot `` Bevo '' , a name which has stuck to this day .
Irving Berlin included a paean to the drink , `` You Ca n't Stay Up on Bevo '' , in his 1917 army revue , Yip Yip Yaphank .
In the late 1920s smuggled bootleg beer and liquor as well as `` homebrew `` , cut into Bevo 's marketshare .
With sales flattening to 100,000 cases by 1929 , Anheuser-Busch stopped production .

what is in milk
Foremilk and Hindmilk samples of human breast milk
A glass of pasteurized cow milk
Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals .
It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food .
Early- lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby .
It also contains many other nutrients .
As an agricultural product , milk is extracted from mammals and used as food for humans .
Worldwide , dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 .
India is the world 's largest producer and consumer of milk , yet neither exports nor imports milk .
New Zealand , the European Union 's 27 member states , Australia , and the United States are the world 's largest exporters of milk and milk products .
China and Russia are the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products .
Throughout the world , there are more than 6 billion consumers of milk and milk products .
Over 750 million people live within dairy farming households .
Milk is a key contributor to improving nutrition and food security particularly in developing countries .
Improvements in livestock and dairy technology offer significant promise in reducing poverty and malnutrition in the world .
What is motorcycle speedway racing
Motorcycle speedway , usually referred to as speedway , is a motorcycle sport involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four anti-clockwise laps of an oval circuit .
Speedway motorcycles use only one gear and have no brakes and racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale .
Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways , powersliding or broadsiding into the bends .
On the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach speeds of up .
The exact origins of the sport are unknown but there is evidence of a type of speedway racing being practised in the USA before the First World War and in Australia in the late 1910s and early 1920s .
There are now both domestic and international competitions in a number of countries including the Speedway World Cup whilst the highest overall scoring individual in the Speedway Grand Prix events is pronounced the world champion .
Speedway is popular in central and northern Europe and to a lesser extent in Australia and North America .
A variant of track racing , speedway is administered internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme ( FIM ) .
Domestic speedway events are regulated by FIM affiliated national motor sport federations .
where is vitamin d found
Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate .
In humans , the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 .
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements .
The body can also synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) when sun exposure is adequate ( hence its nickname , the `` sunshine vitamin '' ) .
Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin , it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense , as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight .
( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet . )
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from their diet .
However , as with other compounds commonly called vitamins , vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease , namely , rickets , the childhood form of osteomalacia .
Additionally , like other compounds called vitamins , in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods , such as milk , to avoid disease due to deficiency .
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet , and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations .
The evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but , because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight , no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine , USA , for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements .
Accordingly , the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet , although that will rarely occur in practice .
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol , which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ) , 25-hydroxycholecalciferol , or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status .
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol , the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood , regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone .
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes , such as the proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation .
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets , the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent .
The best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women .

where are the most concentration of jews living
The Jews ( ISO 259-3 Israeli pronunciation ) , also known as the Jewish people , are a nation and an ethnoreligious group , originating in the Israelites or Hebrews of the Ancient Near East .
The Jewish ethnicity , nationality , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation .
Converts to Judaism , whose status as Jews within the Jewish ethnos is equal to those born into it , have been absorbed into the Jewish people throughout the millennia .
In Jewish tradition , Jewish ancestry is traced to the Biblical patriarchs Abraham , Isaac and Jacob in the second millennium BCE .
The modern State of Israel was established as a Jewish nation-state , and defines itself as such in its Basic Laws .
Its Law of Return grants the right of citizenship to any Jew who requests it .
Israel is the only country where Jews are a majority of the population .
Jews also enjoyed political autonomy twice before in ancient history .
The first of these periods lasted from 1350 to 586 BCE , and encompassed the periods of the Judges , the United Monarchy , and the Divided Monarchy of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah , ending with the destruction of the First Temple .
The second was the period of the Hasmonean Kingdom spanning from 140 to 37 BCE .
Since the destruction of the First Temple , most Jews have lived in diaspora .
A minority in every country in which they live ( except Israel ) , they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history , resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries .
The world Jewish population reached a peak of 15 million prior to the Second World War , but six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust .
Since then the population has risen again and , was estimated at 13.4 million by the North American Jewish Data Bank , or less than 0.2 % of the total world population ( roughly one in every 514 people ) .
According to this report , about 42.5 % of all Jews reside in Israel ( 5.7 million ) , and 39.3 % in the United States ( 5.3 million ) , with most of the remainder living in Europe ( 1.5 million ) and Canada ( 0.4 million ) .
These numbers include all those who consider themselves Jews , whether or not they are affiliated with a Jewish organization .
The total world Jewish population , however , is difficult to measure .
In addition to issues with census methodology , there are halakhic disputes regarding who is a Jew and secular , political , and ancestral identification factors that may affect the figure considerably .

Corpus Domini redirects here .
For other uses see Corpus Domini ( disambiguation )
The Feast of Corpus Christi ( Latin for Body of Christ ) , also known as Corpus Domini , is a Latin Rite liturgical solemnity celebrating the tradition and belief in the body and blood of Jesus Christ and his Real Presence in the Eucharist .
It emphasizes the joy of the institution of the Eucharist , which was observed on Holy Thursday in the somber atmosphere of the nearness of Good Friday .
In the present Roman Missal , the feast is designated the solemnity of The Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ .
It is also celebrated in some Anglican , Lutheran , and Old Catholic Churches that hold similar beliefs regarding the Real Presence .
The feast is liturgically celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday or , `` where the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ is not a Holy Day of Obligation , it is assigned to the Sunday after the Most Holy Trinity as its proper day '' .
At the end of Holy Mass , there is often a procession of the Blessed Sacrament , generally displayed in a monstrance .
The procession is followed by Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament .
A notable Eucharistic procession is that presided over by the Pope each year in Rome , where it begins at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran and makes its way to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major , where it concludes with Benediction .
where is c-reactive protein made
C-reactive protein ( CRP ) is a protein found in the blood , the levels of which rise in response to inflammation ( i.e . C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein ) .
Its physiological role is to bind to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells ( and some types of bacteria ) in order to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex .
CRP is synthesized by the liver in response to factors released by macrophages and fat cells ( adipocytes ) .
It is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins .
It is not related to C-peptide or protein C .
C-reactive protein was the first pattern recognition receptor ( PRR ) to be identified .
who was the first european in the americas
The start of the systematic European colonization of the Americas is typically dated to 1492 , when a Spanish expedition headed by Christopher Columbus sailed for India to open trade but inadvertently discovered the Americas .
European conquest , large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed .
Seeing that Europe was preoccupied with many internal wars and was slowly recovering from the many deaths that the bubonic plague caused , the rapid expansion at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 1400s .
The first expeditions occurred along the Caribbean coasts on the islands of Hispaniola , Puerto Rico and Cuba , and after 1500 extended into the interiors of both North and South America .
In 1497 , sailing from the north on behalf of England , John Cabot landed on the North American coast , and a year later , Columbus 's third voyage reached the South American coast .
France founded colonies in much of eastern North America , on a number of Caribbean islands , and in South America .
Portugal colonized Brazil .
Eventually , the entire Western Hemisphere came under the control of European governments , leading to profound changes to its landscape , population , and plant and animal life .
In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas .
The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange .
who is keith richards married to ?
Keith Richards ( born 18 December 1943 ) is an English musician , singer-songwriter and founder member of the English rock band the Rolling Stones .
Rolling Stone magazine said Richards had created `` rock 's greatest single body of riffs '' , ranking him 4th on its list of 100 best guitarists .
Fourteen songs Richards wrote with the Rolling Stones ' lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among Rolling Stone magazine 's `` 500 Greatest Songs of All Time `` .
Richards ' notoriety for illicit drug use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s and his candour regarding his addiction to and eventual abstinence from heroin .
where is testosterone produced
Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals , reptiles , birds , and other vertebrates .
In mammals , testosterone is primarily secreted in the testicles of males and the ovaries of females , although small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands .
It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid .
In men , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle , bone mass , and the growth of body hair .
In addition , testosterone is essential for health and well-being as well as the prevention of osteoporosis .
On average , in adult human males , the plasma concentration of testosterone is about 7–8 times as great as the concentration in adult human females ' plasma , but as the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men .
Females also are more sensitive to the hormone .
Testosterone is observed in most vertebrates .
Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone .
Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone .
These ubiquitous steroids suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history .
what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling
Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when `` natural '' but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population .
It is often used in marketing research .
In this technique , the total population is divided into these groups ( or clusters ) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected .
Then the required information is collected from a simple random sample of the elements within each selected group .
This may be done for every element in these groups or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups .
A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy .
Assuming a fixed sample size , the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups , not between them .

what is cu the element
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from ) and atomic number 29 .
It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity .
Pure copper is soft and malleable ; a freshly exposed surface has a reddish-orange color .
It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , a building material , and a constituent of various metal alloys .
The metal and its alloys have been used for thousands of years .
In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , hence the origin of the name of the metal as сyprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later shortened to сuprum .
Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments .
Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris ( or patina ) .
Decorative art prominently features copper , both by itself and as part of pigments .
Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase .
In molluscs and crustacea copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin , which is replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates .
The main areas where copper is found in vertebrates are liver , muscle and bone .
In sufficient concentration , copper compounds are poisonous to higher organisms and are used as bacteriostatic substances , fungicides , and wood preservatives .
what is the largest major league sport in the world ?
The major professional sports leagues , or simply major leagues , in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the two countries .
Although individual sports such as golf , tennis , and auto racing are also very popular , the term is usually limited to team sports .
The term `` major league '' was first used in 1921 in reference to Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the top level of professional American baseball .
Today , the major northern North America professional team sports leagues are Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , the National Football League ( NFL ) , and the National Hockey League ( NHL ) .
Other notable leagues include Major League Soccer ( MLS ) , the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) , the Arena Football League , Major League Lacrosse , the National Lacrosse League and the Women 's National Basketball Association .
The NFL , MLB , NBA , and NHL are commonly referred to as the Big Four .
Each of these is the richest professional club competition in its sport worldwide .
The best players can become cultural icons in both countries and elsewhere in the world , because the leagues enjoy a significant place in popular culture in the US and Canada .
The NFL has 32 teams , and the others have 30 each .
The vast majority of major league teams are concentrated in the most populous metropolitan areas of the United States .
Baseball , football , hockey , and soccer have had professional leagues for over 100 years ; early leagues such as the National Association , Ohio League , and National Hockey Association formed the basis of the modern MLB , NFL and NHL respectively .
Soccer was first professionalized in 1894 , but leagues suffered greatly from lack of sustainability and seldom lasted more than a decade .
Soccer 's greatest successes were in the form of the American Soccer League ( 1921-1933 ) , the original North American Soccer League ( 1968-1984 ) , the National Professional Soccer League ( 1984-2001 ) and , currently , Major League Soccer ( 1996-present ) .
Basketball is a relatively new development ; the NBA evolved from the National Basketball League and its splinter group the Basketball Association of America , taking on its current form in 1949 .
Every major league averages 15,000 fans in attendance per game or higher as of 2011 .
what is latitude for observer at equator
Meridian Altitude is an astronomical navigation method of calculating an observer 's latitude .
what is Planned Value Cost
Earned value management ( EVM ) , or Earned value project/performance management ( EVPM ) is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress in an objective manner .
Because EVM has the ability to combine measurements of :
scope
schedule
and cost,
in a single integrated system , Earned Value Management is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems , which is an important contribution for project management .
Early EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use ; and similarly , using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance .
More recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive predictors of project success .
Popularity of EVM has grown significantly in recent years beyond government contracting , in which sector its importance continues to rise ( e.g. , recent new DFAR rules ) , in part because EVM can also surface in and help substantiate contract disputes .
when is the first day of spring
Colorful spring garden flowers
Spring is one of the four conventional temperate seasons , following winter and preceding summer .
There are various technical definitions of spring , but local usage of the term varies according to local climate , cultures and customs .
When it is spring in the northern hemisphere , it will be autumn in the southern hemisphere .
At the spring equinox , days are close to 12 hours long with day length increasing as the season progresses .
Spring and `` springtime '' refer to the season , and also to ideas of rebirth , rejuvenation , renewal , resurrection , and regrowth , with festivals such as Carnival , Easter and Holi being celebrated at this time .
when was jamestown colonized
Jamestown was a settlement in the Colony of Virginia , the first permanent English settlement in the Americas .
Established by the Virginia Company of London as `` James Fort '' on May 14 , 1607 ( O.S . , May 24 , 1607 N.S . ) , it followed several earlier failed attempts , including the Lost Colony of Roanoke .
Jamestown served as the capital of the colony for 83 years , from 1616 until 1699 .
The settlement was located within the territory of a political entity known as Tsenacommacah , the state of the Powhatan Confederacy , with around 14,000 native inhabitants , and specifically was in part of the subdivision known as the Paspahegh tribe .
The natives initially welcomed the colonists with dancing , feasting and tobacco ceremonies , and they provided crucial provisions and support for the survival of the colonists , who were not agriculturally inclined , although relations with the newcomers also soured fairly early on , leading to the total annihilation of the Paspahegh in warfare within 3 years .
Within a year of Jamestown 's founding , the Virginia Company brought Polish and Dutch colonists to help improve the settlement .
In 1619 , the first documented Africans were brought to Jamestown , though the modern conception of slavery in the future United States did not begin in Virginia until 1660 .
When the colony was subdivided into the original eight shires of Virginia in 1634 , the town became located in the eponymous James City Shire .
The London Company 's second settlement , Bermuda , claims to be the site of the oldest town in the English New World , as St. George 's , Bermuda was officially established ( as New London ) in 1612 , whereas James Fort , in Virginia , was not to be converted into James towne until 1619 , and further did not survive into the present day .
In 1699 , the capital was relocated from Jamestown to what is today Williamsburg , after which Jamestown ceased to exist as a settlement , existing today only as an archaeological site .
Today , Jamestown is one of three locations comprising the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia , along with Williamsburg and Yorktown , with two primary heritage sites .
Historic Jamestowne , the archaeological site on Jamestown Island , is a cooperative effort by Jamestown National Historic Site ( part of Colonial National Historical Park ) , and Preservation Virginia .
The Jamestown Settlement , a living history interpretive site , is operated by the Jamestown Yorktown Foundation in conjunction with the Commonwealth of Virginia .

who is on the $ 10 . bill
The United States ten-dollar bill ( $ 10 ) is a denomination of United States currency .
The first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury ( 1789–95 ) , Alexander Hamilton , is currently featured on the obverse of the bill , while the U.S. Treasury Building is featured on the reverse .
( Hamilton is one of two non-presidents featured on currently issued U.S. bills .
The other is Benjamin Franklin , on the $ 100 bill .
Hamilton is one of only four people featured on U.S. paper currency ( 1861 to the present ) who was not born in the continental United States , as he was from the West Indies .
The others are : Albert Gallatin , Switzerland ( $ 500 1862/63 Legal Tender ) ; George Meade , Spain ( $ 1,000 1890/91 Treasury Note ) ; and Robert Morris , England ( $ 1,000 1862/63 Legal Tender ; $ 10 1878/80 Silver Certificate ) .
In addition , Kamehameha I , appears on the 2008 Hawaii state quarter . )
All $ 10 bills issued today are Federal Reserve Notes .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing says the average life of a $ 10 bill in circulation is 18 months before it is replaced due to wear .
Approximately 6 % of all US banknotes printed in 2009 were $ 10 bills .
Ten dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in yellow straps .
The source of the face on the $ 10 bill is John Trumbull ’s 1805 portrait of Hamilton that belongs to the portrait collection of New York City Hall .
The $ 10 bill is the only U.S. paper currency in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left ( the $ 100,000 bill featured a portrait of Woodrow Wilson facing to the left , but was used only for intra-government transactions ) .

who was the first to argue that the sun was the center of the universe
Andreas Cellarius 's illustration of the Copernican system , from the Harmonia Macrocosmica ( 1660 ) .
Heliocentrism , or heliocentricism , is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of the Solar System .
The word comes from the Greek ( helios `` sun '' and kentron `` center '' ) .
Historically , heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism , which placed the Earth at the center .
The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos , but Aristarchus 's heliocentrism attracted little attention until Copernicus revived and elaborated it .
Lucio Russo , however , argues that this is a misleading impression resulting from the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era .
Using indirect evidence he argues that a heliocentric view was expounded in Hipparchus 's work on gravity .
It was not until the 16th century that a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented , by the Renaissance mathematician , astronomer , and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus of Poland , leading to the Copernican Revolution .
In the following century , Johannes Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits , and supporting observations made using a telescope were presented by Galileo Galilei .
With the observations of William Herschel , Friedrich Bessel , and others , astronomers realized that the sun was not the center of the universe and by the 1920s Edwin Hubble had shown that it was part of a galaxy ( the Milky Way ) that was only one of many billions .

what is the fourth dimension of physics
Not to be confused with Dimension of a physical quantity .
For other uses , see Dimension ( disambiguation ) .
From left to right , the square , the cube , and the tesseract .
The square is bounded by 1-dimensional lines , the cube by 2-dimensional areas , and the tesseract by 3-dimensional volumes .
A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen .
The same applies to the tesseract , which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space .
A diagram showing the first four spatial dimensions .
In physics and mathematics , the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it .
Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it ( for example , the point at 5 on a number line ) .
A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it ( for example , to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its latitude and its longitude ) .
The inside of a cube , a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces .
In physical terms , dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space ( volume ) and its position in time ( perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-axis ) , as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that correlate with both particle and field conceptions , interact according to relative properties of mass —and are fundamentally mathematical in description .
These , or other axes , may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or structure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences .
Physical theories that incorporate time , such as general relativity , are said to work in 4-dimensional `` spacetime `` , ( defined as a Minkowski space ) .
Modern theories tend to be `` higher-dimensional '' including quantum field and string theories .
The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space .
The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects .
High-dimensional spaces occur in mathematics and the sciences for many reasons , frequently as configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics ; these are abstract spaces , independent of the physical space we live in .
who is fontana CA named after ?
Fontana ( ) is a city of 200,762 residents in San Bernardino County , California .

What were the major economic activities of the early Canadians
Canadian historians until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history , including labour history .
In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political or military conflicts than other societies .
This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant .
Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians , such as Harold Innis , Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower
Scholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States , but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada .
The heavily Marxist influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history .
A focus on class , urban areas , and industry fails to address Canada 's rural and resource based economy .
Similarly , the monetarist school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border .
The study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on economic geography , and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the staples thesis .
This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of natural resources .
This approach has since also become used outside of Canada in Australia and in many developing nations .
Before the arrival of Europeans , the First Nations of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network .
Furs , tools , decorative items , and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres , mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region .
The early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the staples thesis which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe .
what is Carbon 14 dating is a type of ?
Carbon-14 , 14C , or radiocarbon , is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons .
Its presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues ( 1949 ) to date archaeological , geological and hydrogeological samples .
Carbon-14 was discovered on 27 February 1940 , by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , although its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934 .
There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth : 99 % of the carbon is carbon-12 , 1 % is carbon-13 , and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts , i.e. , making up about 1 part per trillion ( 0.0000000001 % ) of the carbon in the atmosphere .
The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years .
Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay .
The primary natural source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the atmosphere , and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide .
However , open-air nuclear testing between 1955–1980 contributed to this pool .
The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties .
This is used in chemical and biological research , in a technique called carbon labeling : carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon , in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound .
what is the mortality rate for lightning strikes
Lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer
Lightning strikes are electrical discharges on a massive scale between the atmosphere and an earth-bound object .
They mostly originate in thunderclouds and terminate on the ground , called Cloud to Ground ( CG ) lightning .
However , they may also be initiated from a very tall grounded object and reach into the clouds .
Although `` a lightning strike '' is commonly used to describe all lightning , it is rather erroneous and a misnomer , as only about 25 % of all lightning events worldwide are CG , the large bulk of lightning events are Intracloud ( IC ) or Cloud to Cloud ( CC ) , where discharge only occurs high in the atmosphere .
The scientific name for the complete process of a single lightning event is a and it is a very complex , multiple stepped interaction , which is not completely understood .
Most CG flashes only `` strike '' one physical location , referred to as a termination .
The primary conducting channel , the bright coursing light you may see and call a `` strike '' , is only about 1 inch in diameter , although to our eyes it looks much larger .
They are miles long , upwards of tens of miles .
And the entire flash , lasts only a few fractions of a second , most of which is not visible to human eyes .
Thunder is always produced by lightning .
Just like lightning , that deceives our eyes , usually looking larger or closer than it really is , the earth 's atmosphere and our brain 's perception of the outside world , ultimately determines whether it is `` heard '' or not .
Lightning can not happen in a vacuum devoid of ions , nor can thunder occur without molecules to vibrate .
Thunder is a physical absolute for every single flash of lightning .
Contrary to popular belief , a lightning strike itself is usually not responsible for multiple deaths or injuries from a single event .
It would be impossible given the natural tendencies of a flash , unless people or animals were stacked on top of each other , or they were somehow arranged vertically and part of the flash channel .
When lightning ignites an available fuel source and an explosion occurs , it is the shock wave or fire causing the injuries , not the strike itself .
Ground Currents , also called step potential , of an earth termination is what truly causes most injuries or death to humans and animals .
The near instantaneous rush of surface charges , induced by the overhead thundercloud itself , race to the strike point from hundreds to thousands of feet away during discharge .
This current , caused during each stroke , takes the path of least resistance , which may be ion rich human or animal legs , over poorly conducting earth .
This is why it is best to crouch , with feet close together , if ever caught in the open during a thunderstorm .
Unfortunately , most reports do not draw a distinction between the real cause of injury or death , be it the strike itself , a resulting explosion or fire , or usually responsible step potential .

What is sealing contact ?
A couple following their marriage in the Manti Utah Temple .
Sealing is an ordinance ( ritual ) performed in Latter Day Saints temples by a person holding the sealing authority .
The purpose of this ordinance is to seal familiar relationships , making possible the existence of family relationships throughout eternity .
LDS teachings place great importance on the specific authority required to perform these sealings .
Church doctrine teaches that this authority , called the Priesthood , corresponds to that given to Saint Peter in .
Sealings are typically performed as marriages or as sealing of children to parents .
They were performed prior to the death of Joseph Smith , Jr. ( the main founder of the Latter Day Saint movement ) , and are currently performed in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .
Although some other denominations , such as the Community of Christ , view sealing as an artifact of Smith 's practice of plural marriage , some do still perform them .
what was the name of the magazine all teenager read in 2000s
The 2000s , pronounced `` two thousands '' , was a decade that began on January 1 , 2000 , and ended on December 31 , 2009 .
Globalization , which had accelerated after the early 1990s fall of communism , continued to be a force in the 2000s .
The growth of the Internet was one of the prime contributors to globalization during the decade , making it possible for people to interact with other people , express ideas , introduce others to different cultures and backgrounds , use goods and services , sell and buy online , research and learn about things , along with experiencing the world without having to leave home .
The institutions , linkages and technologies that emerged or were redefined earlier would subsequently in this decade benefit many countries , in particular China and India .
However , in other parts of the world such progress failed to address ongoing struggles with modernity , most notably characterized by the rise of al-Qaeda and other Islamist groups .
The September 11 attacks in 2001 led to the United States , United Kingdom , Spain , Canada and other nations invading Afghanistan , as well as implementing various anti-terrorist measures at home and abroad in what was known as the War on Terror .
The European Union saw further integration and expansion throughout much of Europe .
The economic growth of the 2000s had considerable environmental consequences , raised demand for diminishing energy resources , and was still shown to be vulnerable as demonstrated during the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s .
when was the battle at tombstone fought
The Gunfight at the O.K . Corral was a gunfight that took place at about 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday , October 26 , 1881 , in Tombstone , Arizona Territory , and is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the American Old West .
The gunfight , believed to have lasted only about thirty seconds , was fought between the outlaw Cowboys Billy Claiborne , Ike and Billy Clanton , and Tom and Frank McLaury , and the opposing town Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers Assistant Town Marshal Morgan and temporary lawman Wyatt , aided by Doc Holliday designated as a temporary marshal by Virgil .
Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran from the fight unharmed , but Ike 's brother Billy Clanton was killed , along with both McLaurys .
Lawmen Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday were wounded .
Only Wyatt Earp came through the fight unharmed .
The fight has come to represent a time in American history when the frontier was open range for outlaws opposed by law enforcement that was spread thin over vast territories , leaving some areas unprotected .
The gunfight was not well known to the American public until 1931 when author Stuart Lake published what has since been determined to be a largely fictionalized biography , Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal , two years after Earp 's death .
Lake retold his story in a 1946 book that director John Ford developed into the movie My Darling Clementine .
After the movie Gunfight at the O.K . Corral was released in 1957 , the shootout came to be known by that name .
Since then , the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books .
Despite its name , the gunfight actually occurred in a narrow lot six doors west of the rear entrance to the O.K . Corral on Fremont Street , and also in the street .
The two opposing parties were initially only about apart .
About thirty shots were fired in thirty seconds .
Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday but they were eventually exonerated by a local judge after a 30-day preliminary hearing and then again by a local grand jury .
On December 28 , 1881 , Virgil Earp was maimed in an assassination attempt by the outlaw Cowboys , and on March 18 , 1882 , they assassinated Morgan Earp .
The suspects furnished solid alibis , and newly appointed Deputy U.S . Marshal Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands during the Earp Vendetta Ride , ironically pursued by county Sheriff Johnny Behan with warrants for the Earp 's arrest .
what is hdmi out
HDMI ( High-Definition Multimedia Interface ) is a compact audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from a HDMI-compliant device ( `` the source device '' ) to a compatible computer monitor , video projector , digital television , or digital audio device .
HDMI is a digital replacement for existing analog video standards .
There are a number of HDMI-standard cable connectors available , each of which can be used for any uncompressed TV or PC video format , including standard , enhanced , high definition , and 3D video signals ; up to 8 channels of compressed or uncompressed digital audio ; a CEC ( Consumer Electronics Control ) connection ; and an Ethernet data connection .
HDMI implements the EIA/CEA-861 standards , which define video formats and waveforms , transport of compressed , uncompressed , and LPCM audio , auxiliary data , and implementations of the VESA EDID .
The CEC allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one remote control handset .
Because HDMI is electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by digital visual interface ( DVI ) , no signal conversion is necessary , nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used .
As an uncompressed CEA-861 connection , HDMI is independent of the various digital television standards used by individual devices , such as ATSC and DVB , as these are encapsulations of compressed MPEG video streams ( which can be decoded and output as an uncompressed video stream on HDMI ) .
Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003 .
In Europe either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV , formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in 2005 .
HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTV camcorders and digital still cameras in 2006 .
As of January 8 , 2013 , which is ten years after the release of the first HDMI specification , over 3 billion HDMI devices have shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard .

what is renaissance english
Young Man Among Roses , portrait miniature by Nicholas Hilliard , 1588 , V & A .
Believed to be the Earl of Essex
The Ditchley Portrait of Elizabeth I by the foreign Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger , c.1592
The English Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in England dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries to the early 17th century .
It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late 14th century .
Like most of northern Europe , England saw little of these developments until more than a century later .
The beginning of the English Renaissance is often taken , as a convenience , to be 1485 , when the Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and inaugurated the Tudor Dynasty .
Renaissance style and ideas , however , were slow in penetrating England , and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance .

who was in great britain before the anglo-saxons ?
Anglo-Saxon England refers to the period of the history of the part of Britain that became known as England , lasting from the end of Roman occupation and establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the 5th century until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror .
Anglo-Saxon is a general term referring to the Germanic peoples who came to Britain during the 5th and 6th centuries , including Angles , Saxons , Frisii , and Jutes .
The term also refers to the language spoken at the time in England , which is now called Old English , and to the culture of the era , which has long attracted popular and scholarly attention .
Until the 9th century Anglo-Saxon England was dominated by the Heptarchy , the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia , East Anglia , Essex , Kent , Sussex , and Wessex .
In terms of religion the kingdoms followed Anglo-Saxon paganism during the early period , but converted to Christianity during the 7th century .
Paganism had a final stronghold in a period of Mercian hegemony during the 640s , ending with the death of Penda of Mercia in 655 .
Facing the threat of Viking invasions , the House of Wessex became dominant during the 9th century , under the rule of Alfred the Great .
During the 10th century , the individual kingdoms unified under the rule of Wessex into the Kingdom of England , which stood opposed to the Danelaw , the Viking kingdoms established from the 9th century in the north and east of England .
The Kingdom of England fell in the Viking invasion from Denmark in 1013 and was ruled by the House of Denmark until 1042 , when the Anglo-Saxon House of Wessex was restored .
The last Anglo-Saxon king , Harold Godwinson , was killed in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings .

what is the voltage of a medical defibrillator
View of defibrillator electrode position and placement .
Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia .
Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart with a device called a defibrillator .
This depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle , terminates the dysrhythmia , and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the body 's natural pacemaker , in the sinoatrial node of the heart .
Defibrillators can be external , transvenous , or implanted , depending on the type of device used or needed .
Some external units , known as automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms , meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little , or in some cases no training at all .
what was Coco Chanel 's real first name ?
Gabrielle `` Coco '' Bonheur Chanel ( August 19 , 1883 – January 10 , 1971 ) was a French fashion designer and founder of the Chanel brand .
She was the only fashion designer to appear on Time magazine 's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century .
Along with Paul Poiret , Chanel was credited with liberating women from the constraints of the `` corseted silhouette '' and popularizing the acceptance of a sportive , casual chic as the feminine standard in the post- World War I era .
A prolific fashion creator , Chanel 's influence extended beyond couture clothing .
Her design aesthetic was realized in jewelry , handbags , and fragrance .
Her signature scent , Chanel No . 5 , has become an iconic product .
Chanel was known for her lifelong determination , ambition and energy which she applied to her professional and social life .
She achieved both success as a businesswoman and social prominence thanks to the connections she made through her work .
These included many artists and craftspeople to whom she became a patron .
However , Chanel 's highly competitive , opportunistic personality led her to make questionable life choices which have generated controversy around her reputation , particularly her behaviour during the German occupation of France in World War II .

what is romania like ?
Romania ( ; dated spellings Roumania and Rumania ; ) is a country located at the intersection of Central and Southeastern Europe , bordering on the Black Sea .
Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west , Ukraine and Moldova to the northeast and east , and Bulgaria to the south .
At , Romania is the eighth largest country of the European Union by area , and has the seventh largest population of the European Union with more than 19 million people .
Its capital and biggest city is Bucharest , the 11th largest city in the EU .
The United Principalities emerged when the territories of Moldavia and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859 .
In 1866 Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to the throne as the Ruling Prince of the Romanian Principate and in 1881 he was finally crowned as King Carol I the first monarch of the Kingdom of Romania .
Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877 , and was internationally recognized the following year .
At the end of World War I , Transylvania , Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania .
World War II gave cause to the rise of a military dictatorship in Romania under fascist General Ion Antonescu , who chose to fight on the side of the Axis powers from 1941 to 1944 .
After his removal , Romania switched sides in 1944 and joined the Allies .
By the end of the war , some formerly Romanian northeastern territories were occupied by the Soviet Union , with Red Army units stationed on Romanian soil .
In 1947 Romania forcibly became a People 's Republic ( 1947-1965 ) and a member of the Warsaw Pact .
In 1965 Nicolae Ceauşescu became General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party , and the harsh austerity measures , political repression , and cult of personality he implemented led to the Socialist Republic of Romania ( 1965-1989 ) becoming the most Stalinist police state in the Eastern bloc .
Eventually his authoritarian government was toppled in December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution of 1989 .
With the fall of the Iron Curtain , Romania began its transition towards democracy and a capitalist market economy .
After a decade of post-revolution economic problems and living-standards decline , extensive reforms fostered economic recovery .
As of 2010 , Romania is an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index .
Romania joined NATO on 29 March 2004 , and the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
It is also a member of the : Latin Union , Francophonie , OSCE , WTO , BSEC , United Nations , etc .
Today , Romania is a unitary semi-presidential republic , in which the executive branch consists of the President and the Government .
WHERE WAS THE 1ST GREEK CITY FOUND ANCIENT TIMES
`` Ancient '' redirects here .
For other uses , see Antiquity ( disambiguation ) .
The times before writing belong either to protohistory or to prehistory .
Khafre 's Pyramid ( 4th dynasty ) and Great Sphinx of Giza ( c. 2500 BC or perhaps earlier )
Ancient history is the study of the written past from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages .
The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years , with Cuneiform script , the oldest discovered form of coherent writing , from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC .
This is the beginning of history , as opposed to prehistory , according to the definition used by most historians .
The term classical antiquity is often used to refer to history in the Old World from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC ( First Olympiad ) .
This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the founding of Rome in 753 BC , the beginning of the history of ancient Rome , and the beginning of the Archaic period in Ancient Greece .
Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed , some Western scholars use the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD , the closure of the Platonic Academy in 529 AD , the death of the emperor Justinian I , the coming of Islam or the rise of Charlemagne as the end of ancient and Classical European history .
In India , the period includes the early period of the Middle Kingdoms , and , in China , the time up to the Qin Dynasty is included .
what is rda for vitamin b12
Methylcobalamin ( shown ) is a form of vitamin B12 .
Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12 , occurring as dark red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water .
Vitamin B12 , vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12 , also called cobalamin , is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system , and for the formation of blood .
It is one of the eight B vitamins .
It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body , especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation , but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production .
Neither fungi , plants , nor animals are capable of producing vitamin B12 .
Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis , although many foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis .
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis .
Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ) , all of which have vitamin activity .
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt .
Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria ( which usually produce hydroxocobalamin ) , but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body .
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin , cyanocobalamin , does not occur in nature , but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements , and as a food additive , because of its stability and lower production cost .
In the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin , leaving behind the cyanide , albeit in minimal concentration .
More recently , hydroxocobalamin , methylcobalamin , and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements .
The extra utility of these is currently debated .
Vitamin B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia , which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed .
Intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of B12 , so a lack of intrinsic factor , as seen in pernicious anemia , causes a vitamin B12 deficiency .
Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated .
who was the last roman emperor and how old was he when he ruled
The Roman Empire ( ) was the post- Republican period of the ancient Roman civilization , characterised by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean in Europe , Africa , and Asia .
The 500-year-old Roman Republic , which preceded it , had been destabilized through a series of civil wars .
Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire , including Julius Caesar 's appointment as perpetual dictator ( 44 BC ) ; the Battle of Actium ( 31 BC ) ; and the granting of the honorific Augustus to Octavian by the Roman Senate ( 27 BC ) .
The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ) .
It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of Trajan ( 98–117 AD ) .
In the 3rd century , the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence , but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors Aurelian and Diocletian .
Christians rose to power in the 4th century , during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the Latin West and Greek East .
After the collapse of central government in the West in the 5th century , the eastern half continued as what would later be known as the Byzantine Empire .
Because of the Empire 's vast extent and long endurance , the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language , religion , architecture , philosophy , law , and forms of government in the territory it governed , particularly Europe , and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world .
what is the rule of the 9s
Total body surface area ( TBSA ) is an assessment measure of burns of the skin .
In adults , the `` rule of nines '' is used to determine the total percentage of area burned for each major section of the body .
In some cases , the burns may cover more than one body part , or may not fully cover such a part ; in these cases , burns are measured by using the casualty 's palm as a reference point for 1 % of the body .
For children and infants , the Lund-Browder chart is used to assess the burned body surface area .
Different percentages are used because the ratio of the combined surface area of the head and neck to the surface area of the limbs is typically larger in children than that of an adult .
Typical values for common groups of humans follow .
( Due to rounding , values may not add to 100 % . )

what is the root word of ovaries
This is a list of roots , suffixes , and prefixes used in medical terminology , their meanings , and their etymology .
There are a few rules when using medical roots .
Firstly , prefixes and suffixes , primarily in Greek , but also in Latin , have a droppable -o- .
As a general rule , this -o- almost always acts as a joint-stem to connect two consonantal roots , e.g . arthr- + -o- + logy = arthrology .
But generally , the -o- is dropped when connecting to a vowel-stem ; e.g . arthr- + itis = arthritis , instead of arthr-o-itis .
Secondly , medical roots generally go together according to language : Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes .
Although international scientific vocabulary is not stringent about segregating combining forms of different languages , it is advisable when coining new words not to mix different lingual roots .

The Berlin blockade ( 24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949 ) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War .
During the multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany , the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies ' railway , road , and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control .
Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city .
In response , the Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin .
Aircrews from the United States Air Force , the British Royal Air Force , the Royal Australian Air Force , the Royal Canadian Air Force , the Royal New Zealand Air Force , and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year , providing up to 4700 tons of daily necessities such as fuel and food to the Berliners .
By the spring of 1949 , the effort was clearly succeeding and , by April , the airlift was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail .
The success of the Berlin Airlift brought embarrassment to the Soviets who had refused to believe it could make a difference .
The blockade was lifted in May 1949 and resulted in the creation of two separate German states .
The Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) split up Berlin .
In remembrance of the airlift , three airports in the former western zones of the city served as the primary gateways to Germany for another fifty years .

what is el mate
Mate ( , ; sometimes also spelled maté ) , also known as chimarrão ( ) or cimarrón ( ) , is a traditional South American infused drink , particularly in Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay and the southern states of Brazil and to a lesser degree in south of Chile , the Bolivian Chaco , Syria and Lebanon .
It is prepared from steeping dried leaves of yerba mate ( llex paraguariensis , known in Portuguese as erva-mate ) in hot water .
Mate is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd .
The straw is called a bombilla in some Latin American countries , a bomba in Portuguese , and a bombija or , more generally , a masassa ( type of straw ) in Arabic .
The straw is traditionally made of silver .
Modern , commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver , called Alpaca ; stainless steel , or hollow-stemmed cane .
The gourd is known as a mate or a guampa ; while in Brazil , it has the specific name of cuia , or also cabaça ( the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil , still used for general food and drink in remote regions ) .
Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos , the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias .
As with other brewed herbs , yerba mate leaves are dried , chopped , and ground into a powdery mixture called yerba .
The bombilla acts as both a straw and a sieve .
The submerged end is flared , with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in , but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture .
A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes , or spring sleeve to act as a sieve .
`` Tea-bag '' type infusions of mate ( mate cocido ) have been on the market in Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay for many years under such trade names as `` Taragüí Vitality '' in Argentina , `` Pajarito '' and `` Kurupí '' in Paraguay , and in Brazil under the name `` Mate Leão '' .
This is considered a completely different drink .
It is never drunk from cuias or called chimarrão , nor is it associated with the gaucho/gaúcho culture .
where was the auto industry started
The automotive industry is a term that covers a wide range of companies and organisations involved in the design , development , manufacture , marketing , and selling of motor vehicles , towed vehicles , motorcycles and mopeds .

What was the original name of the holiday known today as Halloween ?
Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of `` All Hallows ' Evening `` ) , also known as All Hallows ' Eve , is a yearly celebration observed in a number of countries on October 31 , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ( or All Saints ) and the day initiating the triduum of Hallowmas .
According to many scholars , All Hallows ' Eve is a Christianised feast originally influenced by western European harvest festivals , and festivals of the dead with possible pagan roots , particularly the Celtic Samhain .
Other scholars maintain that it originated independently of Samhain and has solely Christian roots .
Typical festive Halloween activities include trick-or-treating ( also known as `` guising `` ) , attending costume parties , carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns , lighting bonfires , apple bobbing , visiting haunted attractions , playing pranks , telling scary stories , and watching horror films .
what is the age you have to be to have the right to freedom of speech
Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one 's opinions and ideas using one 's body and property to anyone who is willing to receive them .
The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously , but includes any act of seeking , receiving and imparting information or ideas , regardless of the medium used .
In practice , the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations , as with libel , slander , obscenity , sedition ( including , for example inciting ethnic hatred ) , copyright violation , revelation of information that is classified or otherwise .
The right to freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) .
Article 19 of the ICCPR states that `` [ e ] veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference '' and `` everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression ; this right shall include freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds , regardless of frontiers , either orally , in writing or in print , in the form of art , or through any other media of his choice '' .
Article 19 goes on to say that the exercise of these rights carries `` special duties and responsibilities `` and may `` therefore be subject to certain restrictions '' when necessary `` [ f ] or respect of the rights or reputation of others '' or `` [ f ] or the protection of national security or of public order ( order public ) , or of public health or morals '' .
Freedom of speech may be legally curtailed in some religious legal systems and in secular jurisdictions where it is found to cause religious offense , such as the British Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 .
when was the sydney harbour bridge built
Sydney Harbour from the air , showing the Opera House , the CBD , Circular Quay , the Bridge , the Parramatta River , North Sydney and Kirribilli in the foreground
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail , vehicular , bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district ( CBD ) and the North Shore .
The dramatic view of the bridge , the harbour , and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney , New South Wales , and Australia .
The bridge is nicknamed `` The Coathanger '' because of its arch-based design .
Under the directions of Dr J.J.C . Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works , the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough and opened in 1932 .
The bridge 's design was influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge in New York .
It was the world 's widest long-span bridge , at 48.8 meters ( 160 feet ) wide , until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver .
It is also the fifth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world , and it is the tallest steel arch bridge , measuring from top to water level .
Until 1967 the Harbour Bridge was Sydney 's tallest structure .
what is the name for the oldest island in the hawaiian hot spots
The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands , in the northern Pacific Ocean .
One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain , an over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long chain of volcanoes , four of which are active , two of which are dormant , and more than 123 of which are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls .
The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia .
While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from nearby plate boundaries ; the classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years .
According to this theory , the nearly 60° bend separating the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate .
In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 million year old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's .
Ancient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands .
The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology , embodied in Pele , the deity of volcanoes .
After the arrival of Europeans on the island , in 1880-1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot 's volcanics , confirming the relationship long observed by the natives .
1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar , initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands .
In the 1970s , a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii 's seafloor .
The hotspot has since been tomographically imaged , showing it to be wide and up to deep , and olivine and garnet -based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately .
In its at least 85 million years of activity the hotspot has produced an estimated of rock .
The chain 's rate of drift has slowly increased over time , causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease , from 18 million years for the 76 million year old Detroit Seamount , to just under 900,000 for the one million year-old Kohala ; on the other hand , eruptive volume has increased from per year to about .
Overall , this has caused a trend towards more active but quickly-silenced , closely spaced volcanoes—whereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other ( forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the ancient Maui Nui ) , the oldest of the Emperor seamounts are spaced as far as apart .

what is the disease osteonecrosis of the jaw ?
Osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ) is a severe bone disease that affects the maxilla and the mandible .
Various forms of ONJ have been described over the last 160 years , and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature .
Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate therapy , required by some cancer treatment regimens , has been identified and defined as a pathological entity since 2003 .
The possible risk from lower oral doses of bisphosphonates , taken by patients to prevent or treat osteoporosis , remains uncertain .
Various treatment options have been explored , however severe cases of ONJ still require surgical removal of the affected bone .
A thorough history and assessement of pre-existing systemic problems and possible sites of dental infection are required to help prevent the condition , especially if bisphosphonate therapy is considered .
What was the nickname of the 1967 Red Sox team that outperformed expectations and made it to the World Series
The Boston Red Sox are a professional baseball team based in Boston , Massachusetts , and a member of Major League Baseball 's American League Eastern Division .
Founded in as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox 's home ballpark has been Fenway Park since .
The `` Red Sox '' name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , around , following previous Boston teams that had been known as the `` Red Stockings `` .
They have played in 11 World Series , winning 7 .
Boston was a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in and winning four more championships by .
However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , called by some the `` Curse of the Bambino `` after its alleged beginning with the Red Sox 's sale of Babe Ruth to the rival Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in .
However , the team 's history during that period was hardly one of futility , but was rather punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's `` mad dash `` in , the `` Impossible Dream `` of , Carlton Fisk 's home run in , and Bill Buckner 's error in .
Red Sox history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports .
The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group , who also own Liverpool Football Club of the Premier League in England .
The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance , while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance .
From May 15 , 2003 to April 10 , 2013 , the Red Sox sold out every home game-a total of 820 games ( 794 regular season ) for a major professional sports record that lasted almost a decade .

what is Polyester in packaging PET
Polyethylene terephthalate ( sometimes written poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) ) , commonly abbreviated PET , PETE , or the obsolete PETP or PET-P , is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in synthetic fibers ; beverage , food and other liquid containers ; thermoforming applications ; and engineering resins often in combination with glass fiber .
The term polyethylene terephthalate is a source of confusion because this substance , PET , does not contain polyethylene .
Thus , the alternate form , poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) , is often used in scholarly journals for the sake of accuracy and clarity .
Depending on its processing and thermal history , polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous ( transparent ) and as a semi-crystalline polymer .
The semicrystalline material might appear transparent ( particle size < 500 nm ) or opaque and white ( particle size up to a few microns ) depending on its crystal structure and particle size .
Its monomer ( bis-β-hydroxyterephthalate ) can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct , or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate with methanol as a byproduct .
Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers ( done immediately after esterification/transesterification ) with water as the byproduct .
The majority of the world 's PET production is for synthetic fibers ( in excess of 60 % ) , with bottle production accounting for around 30 % of global demand .
In the context of textile applications , PET is referred to by its common name , `` polyester , '' whereas the acronym `` PET '' is generally used in relation to packaging .
Polyester makes up about 18 % of world polymer production and is the third-most-produced polymer ; polyethylene ( PE ) and polypropylene ( PP ) are first and second , respectively .
PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate , with repeating C10H8O4 units .
PET is commonly recycled , and has the number `` 1 '' as its recycling symbol .

what is the female symbol called
A gender symbol denotes the sex of an organism or characterizes an agent by gender .
The two standard gender symbols denoting male ♂ and female ♀ are derived from astrological symbols , denoting the classical planets Mars and Venus , respectively .
These symbols have been in use since the Renaissance also denoting elements in alchemy , specifically the metals iron and copper .
They were first used to denote the effective gender of plants ( i.e . sex of individual in a given crossbreed , since most plants are hermaphroditic ) by Carolus Linnaeus in 1751 .
what is leasehold ; real estate
A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord .
Although a tenant does hold rights to real property , a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property .
Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time .
As lease is a legal estate , leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market .
A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time , and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let ( rented ) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly .
Until the end of the lease period ( often measured in decades or centuries ; a 99 year lease is quite common ) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner .
Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease , which has elements of contract and property law intertwined .
The term estate for years may occasionally be used .
This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time ( the word `` years '' is misleading ) .
An estate for years is not automatically renewed .
Colloquially , `` lease '' and `` leasing `` are often a formalization of a longer , specific period as compared with a `` rental '' that created a tenancy at will , terminable or renewable at the end of a short period .

where was the first canal in panama located
Location of Panama between Pacific ( bottom ) and Caribbean ( top ) , with canal at top center
The Panama Canal ( ) is a ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean ( via the Caribbean Sea ) to the Pacific Ocean .
The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade .
There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake ( above sea-level ) .
Gatun Lake was created to reduce the amount of work required for the canal .
The current locks are wide .
A third , wider lane of locks is being built .
France began work on the canal in 1881 , but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease .
The United States ( US ) later took over the project and took a decade to complete the canal in 1914 , enabling ships to avoid the lengthy Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America ( via the Drake Passage ) or to navigate the Strait of Magellan .
One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required .
The shorter , faster , safer route to the US West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy .
During this time , ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian , then French , and then American ; the United States completed the construction .
The canal was taken over in 1999 by the Panamanian government , as long planned .
Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914 , to 14,702 vessels in 2008 , the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System ( PC/UMS ) tons .
By 2008 , more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal , many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned ; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax .
The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world .
who was the president when benjamin franklin was alive
Benjamin Franklin ( April 17 , 1790 ) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States .
A noted polymath , Franklin was a leading author , printer , political theorist , politician , postmaster , scientist , musician , inventor , satirist , civic activist , statesman , and diplomat .
As a scientist , he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity .
He invented the lightning rod , bifocals , the Franklin stove , a carriage odometer , and the glass 'armonica ' .
He facilitated many civic organizations , including a fire department and a university .
Franklin earned the title of `` The First American '' for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity ; as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies , then as the first United States Ambassador to France , he exemplified the emerging American nation .
Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self-governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment .
In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager , `` In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat . ''
To Walter Isaacson , this makes Franklin `` the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become . ''
Franklin , always proud of his working class roots , became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia , the leading city in the colonies .
He was also partners with William Goddard and Joseph Galloway the three of whom published the Pennsylvania Chronicle , a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British monarchy in the American colonies .
He became wealthy publishing Poor Richard 's Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette .
Franklin gained international renown as a scientist for his famous experiments in electricity and for his many inventions , especially the lightning rod .
He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society .
Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act .
An accomplished diplomat , he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations .
For many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies , which enabled him to set up the first national communications network .
He was active in community affairs , colonial and state politics , as well as national and international affairs .
From 1785 to 1788 , he served as governor of Pennsylvania .
Toward the end of his life , he freed his slaves and became one of the most prominent abolitionists .
His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement , and status as one of America 's most influential Founding Fathers , have seen Franklin honored on coinage and money ; warships ; the names of many towns , counties , educational institutions , namesakes , and companies ; and more than two centuries after his death , countless cultural references .

what is the earth 's orbital speed
The orbital speed of a body , generally a planet , a natural satellite , an artificial satellite , or a multiple star , is the speed at which it orbits around the barycenter of a system , usually around a more massive body .
It can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed , the average speed as it completes an orbit , or instantaneous orbital speed , the speed at a particular point in its orbit .
The orbital speed at any position in the orbit can be computed from the distance to the central body at that position , and the specific orbital energy , which is independent of position : the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the potential energy .

what is the resolution of a standard dvd ?
DVD-Video is a consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD discs , and is currently the dominant consumer video format in Asia , North America , Europe , and Australia .
Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a DVD drive and an H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 decoder ( e.g. , a DVD player , or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player ) .
Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination of H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 compressed video and audio of varying formats ( often multi-channel formats as described below ) .
Typically , the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3 Mbit/s to 9.5 Mbit/s , and the bit rate is usually adaptive .
It was first available for retail around 1997 .
The DVD-Video specification was created by DVD Forum and can be obtained from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $ 5,000 .
The specification is not publicly available , because every subscriber must sign a non-disclosure agreement .

WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF A NAUTICAL MILE
The nautical mile ( symbol M , NM or nmi ) is a unit of length that is about one minute of arc of latitude measured along any meridian , or about one minute of arc of longitude at the equator .
By international agreement it has been set at 1,852 metres exactly ( about 6,076 feet ) .
It is a non- SI unit ( although accepted for use in the International System of Units by the BIPM ) used especially by navigators in the shipping and aviation industries , and also in polar exploration .
It is commonly used in international law and treaties , especially regarding the limits of territorial waters .
It developed from the sea mile and the related geographical mile .
The nautical mile remains in use by sea and air navigators worldwide because of its convenience when working with charts .
Most nautical charts use the Mercator projection whose scale varies by about a factor of six from the equator to 80° latitude , so charts covering large areas can not use a single linear scale .
The nautical mile is nearly equal to a minute of latitude on a chart , so a distance measured with a chart divider can be roughly converted to nautical miles using the chart 's latitude scale .

what is firewire used for
The IEEE 1394 interface is a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer .
It was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Apple , who called it FireWire .
The 1394 interface is comparable to USB , and often those two technologies are considered together , though USB has more market share .
Apple first included FireWire in some of its 1999 models , and most Apple computers since the year 2000 have included FireWire ports , though , as of 2013 , nothing beyond the 800 version ( IEEE-1394b ) .
The interface is also known by the brand i.LINK ( Sony ) , and Lynx ( Texas Instruments ) .
IEEE 1394 replaced parallel SCSI in many applications , because of lower implementation costs and a simplified , more adaptable cabling system .
The 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface , though this is not as widely used .
IEEE 1394 is the High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance ( HANA ) standard connection interface for A/V ( audio/visual ) component communication and control .
FireWire is also available in wireless , fiber optic , and coaxial versions using the isochronous protocols .

when were forever stamps introduced
The main components of a stamp:
1 . Image
2 . Perforations
3 . Denomination
4 . Country name
A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage .
Typically , stamps are made from special paper , with a national designation and denomination ( price ) on the face , and a gum adhesive on the reverse side .
Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration .
The stamp’s shape is usually that of a small rectangle of varying proportions , though triangles or other shapes are occasionally used .
The stamp is affixed to an envelope or other postal cover ( i.e. , packet , box , mailing cylinder ) that the customer wishes to send .
The item is then processed by the postal system , where a postmark , sometimes known as a cancellation mark , is usually applied over the stamp and cover ; this procedure marks the stamp as used , which prevents its reuse .
The postmark indicates the date and point of origin of the mailing .
The mailed item is then delivered to the address that the customer has applied to the envelope or cover .
Postage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840s .
Before this time , ink and hand-stamps ( hence the word 'stamp ' ) , usually made from wood or cork , were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage .
The first adhesive postage stamp , commonly referred to as the Penny Black , was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840 .
The invention of the stamp was a part of the attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , which in the early 19th century was in disarray and rife with corruption .
There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp .
Before the introduction of postage stamps , mail in the UK was paid for by the recipient , a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem : the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items , and senders had no incentive to restrict the number , size , or weight of items sent , whether or not they would ultimately be paid for .
The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner , with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced .
Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes , post cards , lettercards , aerogrammes and wrappers , postage meters , and , more recently , specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for priority or express mailing .
The postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials , more efficiently recovered costs for the postal service , and ultimately resulted in a better , faster postal system .
With the conveniences stamps offered , their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries .
Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail , but by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses . )
The same result with respect to communications by private parties occurred over the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st due to declining cost of long distance telephone communications and the development and explosive spread of electronic mailing ( `` e-mail '' via the Internet ) and bill paying systems had .
As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis , historians and collectors began to take notice .
The study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as philately .
Stamp collecting can be both a hobby and a form of historical study and reference , as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations .

what is tofu made of
Tofu , also called bean curd , is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks .
It is a component in many East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines .
There are many different varieties of tofu , including fresh tofu and tofu that has been processed in some way .
Tofu has a subtle flavor and can be used in savory and sweet dishes .
It is often seasoned or marinated to suit the dish .
Tofu originated in ancient China some 2,000 years ago .
Chinese legend ascribes its invention to prince Liu An ( Chinese : 劉安 Liú Ān , 179–122 BC ) .
Tofu and its production technique were introduced into Korea and then Japan during the Nara period .
It spread into other parts of East Asia as well .
This spread likely coincided with the spread of Buddhism because it is an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet of East Asian Buddhism .
Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty described a method of making tofu in Bencao Gangmu .
Tofu has a low calorie count , relatively large amounts of protein , and little fat .
It is high in iron and depending on the coagulant used in manufacturing , may also be high in calcium and/or magnesium .
Where is Bubbles the Chimp now
Bubbles ( born 1983 ) is a common chimpanzee , known for being the one-time pet of American recording artist Michael Jackson , who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s .
The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer , whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and , among other factors , to a public perception of Jackson as an eccentric .
During the Bad World Tour , for example , Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan , where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka .
Bubbles was initially kept at the Jackson family 's home in Encino , Los Angeles , but was moved to Neverland Ranch in 1988 .
There , he slept in a crib in Jackson 's bedroom , used the singer 's toilet , and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater .
In 2003 the public learned that , like all captive chimpanzees , Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal .
He was sent to a California animal trainer , where he was reported to have attempted suicide .
When the trainer shut down his operation in 2004 , Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes , a sanctuary in Wauchula , Florida , where he has lived since 2005 .

what is life all about
Where Do We Come From ?
What Are We ?
Where Are We Going ?
One of Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin 's most famous paintings .
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general .
It can also be expressed in different forms , such as `` Why are we here ? `` , `` What is life all about ? `` , and `` What is the purpose of existence ? ''
It has been the subject of much philosophical , scientific , and theological speculation throughout history .
There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds .
The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence , social ties , consciousness , and happiness , and borders on many other issues , such as symbolic meaning , ontology , value , purpose , ethics , good and evil , free will , the existence of one or multiple Gods , conceptions of God , the soul , and the afterlife .
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe , exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how ' of life .
Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality .
An alternative , humanistic approach poses the question `` What is the meaning of my life ? ''
The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality , or a feeling of oneness , or even a feeling of sacredness .

`` The Princess and the Pea '' ( ; literal translation : `` The Princess on the Pea '' ) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a young woman whose royal identity is established by a test of her physical sensitivity .
The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8 May 1835 in Copenhagen by C.A . Reitzel .
Andersen had heard the story as a child , and it likely has its source in folk material , possibly originating from Sweden as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition .
Neither `` The Princess and the Pea '' nor Andersen 's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics , who disliked their casual , chatty style , and their lack of morals .
In 1959 `` The Princess and the Pea '' was adapted to the musical stage in a production called Once Upon a Mattress starring Carol Burnett .
what was life like for immigrant germans in america
German Americans ( ) are citizens of the United States who were either born in Germany or are of German ancestry .
They comprise about 50 million people , making them the largest ancestry group ahead of Irish Americans , African Americans and English Americans .
They comprise about 1/3 of the German diaspora all over the world .
None of the German states had New World colonies .
Not until the 1670s did the first significant groups of German immigrants arrive in the British colonies , settling primarily in New York and Pennsylvania .
Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century , with some eight million arrivals from Germany .
They were pulled by the attractions of land and religious freedom , and pushed out of Europe by shortages of land and religious or political oppression .
Many arrived seeking religious or political freedom , others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe , and others simply for the chance to start fresh in the New World .
The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land , where their intensive farming techniques would pay off .
After 1840 , many came to cities , where `` Germania '' —German-speaking districts—soon emerged .
German Americans established the first kindergartens in the United States , introduced the Christmas tree tradition , and originated popular American foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers .
German American celebrations are held throughout the country , one of the most well-known being the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City , held every third Saturday in September .
There are also major annual events in Chicago , Cincinnati , Milwaukee , Pittsburgh , St. Louis and other cities .
Like many other immigrants that came to the United States , an overwhelming number of people of German or partial German descent have essentially become Americanized .
what is in the preamble of the constitution
The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution 's fundamental purposes and guiding principles .
It states in general terms , and courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of , the Founding Fathers ' intentions regarding the Constitution 's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve as it pertains to all of the people of the United States .
As the phrase , `` we the people '' suggests that the new government originates from the people of the United States and it sets into motion a question as it pertains to that vast population concerning the individual rights and equality among all people ; this can be seen most broadly in the divide between republicanism and social democracy .
when was the internet started
The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s .
The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANet from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock 's laboratory at University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , after the second piece of network equipment was installed at Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) .
Packet switched networks such as ARPANET , Mark I at NPL in the UK , CYCLADES , Merit Network , Tymnet , and Telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols .
The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking , in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks .
In 1982 , the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was standardized , and consequently , the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected TCP/IP networks , called the Internet , was introduced .
Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) developed the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) and again in 1986 when NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations .
Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 .
The Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET was decommissioned , removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic .
Since the mid-1990s , the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce , including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail , instant messaging , Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) `` phone calls '' , two-way interactive video calls , and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums , blogs , social networking , and online shopping sites .
The research and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as NSF 's very high speed Backbone Network Service ( vBNS ) , Internet2 , and National LambdaRail .
Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s , 10-Gbit/s , or more .
The Internet 's takeover over the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993 , already 51 % by 2000 , and more than 97 % of the telecommunicated information by 2007 .
Today the Internet continues to grow , driven by ever greater amounts of online information , commerce , entertainment , and social networking .

when was Pope Benedict XVI elected ?
Benedict XVI ( , , ; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on 16 April 1927 ) is Pope emeritus of the Catholic Church .
He served as Pope from 2005 to 2013 .
In that position , he was both the leader of the Catholic Church and Sovereign of the Vatican City State .
Benedict was elected on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave , celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24 April 2005 , and took possession of his cathedral , the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran , on 7 May 2005 .
Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria , Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958 .
After a long career as an academic , serving as a professor of theology at several German universities—the last being the University of Regensburg , where he served as Vice President of the university in 1976 and 1977—he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977 , an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience .
In 1981 , he settled in Rome when he became Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia .
From 2002 until his election as pope , he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals , and as such , the primus inter pares among the cardinals .
Prior to becoming pope , he was `` a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century '' as `` one of the most respected , influential and controversial members of the College of Cardinals '' ; he had an influence `` second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions '' as one of Pope John Paul II 's closest confidants .
He was originally a liberal theologian , but adopted conservative views after 1968 .
His prolific writings defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values .
During his papacy , Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries .
He views relativism 's denial of objective truth , and the denial of moral truths in particular , as the central problem of the 21st century .
He taught the importance of both the Catholic Church and an understanding of God 's redemptive love .
Pope Benedict also revived a number of traditions including elevating the Tridentine Mass to a more prominent position .
He renewed the relationship between the Catholic Church and art , viewing the use of beauty as a path to the sacred , promoted the use of Latin , and reintroduced traditional papal garments , for which reason he was called `` the pope of aesthetics '' .
He has been described as `` the main intellectual force in the Church '' since the mid-1980s .
Several of Pope Benedict 's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him , notably Christoph Schönborn .
On 11 February 2013 , Pope Benedict announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals , citing a `` lack of strength of mind and body '' due to his advanced age .
His resignation became effective on 28 February 2013 .
He is the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415 , and the first to do so on his own initiative since Pope Celestine V in 1294 .
As pope emeritus , Benedict retains the style of His Holiness , and the title of Pope , and will continue to dress in the papal colour of white .
He was succeeded by Pope Francis on 13 March 2013 , and he moved into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae monastery for his retirement on 2 May 2013..
what is the difference between magic eye 3d illusions and 3d technology ?
Pocket stereoscope with original test image .

Company of ladies watching stereoscopic photographs , painting by Jacob Spoel , before 1868 .
A very early depiction of people using a stereoscope .
Stereoscopy ( also called stereoscopics or 3D imaging ) is a technique for creating or enhancing the illusion of depth in an image by means of stereopsis for binocular vision .
The word stereoscopy derives from the Greek `` στερεός '' ( stereos ) , `` firm , solid '' + `` σκοπέω '' ( skopeō ) , `` to look '' , `` to see '' .
Most stereoscopic methods present two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer .
These two-dimensional images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of 3D depth .
This technique is distinguished from 3D displays that display an image in three full dimensions , allowing the observer to increase information about the 3-dimensional objects being displayed by head and eye movements .
Who was John Adam 's children
John Adams ( October 30 , 1735 ( O.S . October 19 , 1735 ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was the second president of the United States ( 1797–1801 ) , having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States .
An American Founding Father , he was a statesman , diplomat , and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain .
Well educated , he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas , both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers .
Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution .
A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence .
He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , and was its primary advocate in the Congress .
Later , as a diplomat in Europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers .
A political theorist and historian , Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought .
One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States .
Adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .
During his one term , he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton .
Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war ( called the `` Quasi-War `` ) with France , 1798–1800 .
The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton 's opposition .
In 1800 , Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts .
He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson .
He and his wife , Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the Adams political family .
Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States .
His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times , though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders .
Adams was the first U.S. president to reside in the building that eventually became known as the White House .
who was on the 10 dollar bill
The United States ten-dollar bill ( $ 10 ) is a denomination of United States currency .
The first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury ( 1789–95 ) , Alexander Hamilton , is currently featured on the obverse of the bill , while the U.S. Treasury Building is featured on the reverse .
( Hamilton is one of two non-presidents featured on currently issued U.S. bills .
The other is Benjamin Franklin , on the $ 100 bill .
Hamilton is one of only four people featured on U.S. paper currency ( 1861 to the present ) who was not born in the continental United States , as he was from the West Indies .
The others are : Albert Gallatin , Switzerland ( $ 500 1862/63 Legal Tender ) ; George Meade , Spain ( $ 1,000 1890/91 Treasury Note ) ; and Robert Morris , England ( $ 1,000 1862/63 Legal Tender ; $ 10 1878/80 Silver Certificate ) .
In addition , Kamehameha I , appears on the 2008 Hawaii state quarter . )
All $ 10 bills issued today are Federal Reserve Notes .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing says the average life of a $ 10 bill in circulation is 18 months before it is replaced due to wear .
Approximately 6 % of all US banknotes printed in 2009 were $ 10 bills .
Ten dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in yellow straps .
The source of the face on the $ 10 bill is John Trumbull ’s 1805 portrait of Hamilton that belongs to the portrait collection of New York City Hall .
The $ 10 bill is the only U.S. paper currency in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left ( the $ 100,000 bill featured a portrait of Woodrow Wilson facing to the left , but was used only for intra-government transactions ) .
what is water jet propulsion
A rider on a Yamaha Waverunner XL performing a high-speed turn .
A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft .
Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat , a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat , then expels it through a nozzle at the stern .
Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton ( who developed a waterjet in 1954 ) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters .
Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes , generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers .
Unlike these previous waterjet developments , such as Campini 's and the Hanley Hydrojet , Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water , and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution .
From this , the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly .
Through further developments , it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types , and as such , waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels , including passenger ferries , rescue craft , patrol boats and offshore supply vessels .
Jetboats are highly maneuverable , and many can , from full speed , be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length , in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop '' .
The well known Hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is cut , the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again , causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water .
There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats , though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application .
Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds , up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this , the extra hull resistance generated by struts , rudders , shafts ( etc . ) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range ( up to ) .
Also , in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds ( such as tug boats ) , the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical .
For these reasons , the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught , maneuverability , and load flexibility are main concerns .
The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry .
South Africa 's s ( approximately long ) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far .
Even these German-built vessels are capable of performing `` crash stops '' .
what is the icd 9 code for anterior synechiae
Uveitis is broadly defined as inflammation of the uvea .
The uvea consists of the middle , pigmented , vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris , ciliary body , and choroid .
Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist along with urgent treatment to control the inflammation .
who is E from entourage

where was the Shining filmed
The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick , co-written with novelist Diane Johnson , and starring Jack Nicholson , Shelley Duvall , Scatman Crothers , and Danny Lloyd .
The film is based on the Stephen King novel The Shining .
A writer , Jack Torrance , takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel .
His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future , such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel .
Soon after settling in , the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm , and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence ; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son .
Unlike previous Kubrick films , which developed an audience gradually by building on word-of-mouth , The Shining was released as a mass-market film , opening at first in just two cities on Memorial Day , then nationwide a month later .
Although initial response to the film was mixed , later critical assessment was more favorable and it is now viewed as a classic of the horror genre .
Film director Martin Scorsese , writing in The Daily Beast , ranked it as one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time .
Film critics , film students , and Kubrick 's producer , Jan Harlan , have remarked on the enormous influence the film has had on popular culture .
The initial European release of The Shining was 25 minutes shorter than the American version , achieved by removing most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel .
what is diet pepsi flavored with
Patio Cola Bottle
Patio Diet Cola was a brand of diet soda introduced by Pepsi in 1963 .
It was created in response to Diet Rite Cola , which was the first diet cola on the market .
Fitness promoter Debbie Drake was Patio Diet Cola 's spokesperson .
In 1964 , Patio released orange , grape , and root beer flavors .
This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush , but rather fill out the line .
Patio sodas were available in the cold-bottle market : grocery and mom-and-pop stores .
Advertising for Patio was comparatively scarce ; at the time , bottlers were regionally franchised , and related advertising was necessarily local .
In 1964 , Patio diet cola became Diet Pepsi .
The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi with the tagline `` Pepsi either way '' , which replaced the slogan `` Dances with flavor '' .
The short life span of Patio Diet cola makes it a great addition for bottle collectors .
Most of the remaining Patio line of flavors were phased out by the early 1970s , while a few survived until the mid 70s
what is Non-profit infrastructure
Infrastructure is basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society or enterprise , or the services and facilities necessary for an economy to function .
It can be generally defined as the set of interconnected structural elements that provide framework supporting an entire structure of development .
It is an important term for judging a country or region 's development .
The term typically refers to the technical structures that support a society , such as roads , bridges , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , telecommunications , and so forth , and can be defined as `` the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions . ''
Viewed functionally , infrastructure facilitates the production of goods and services , and also the distribution of finished products to markets , as well as basic social services such as schools and hospitals ; for example , roads enable the transport of raw materials to a factory .
In military parlance , the term refers to the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support , redeployment , and operation of military forces .
To make it simple , infrastructure is anything that is needed everyday , an everyday item .
what is genetic differences
A graphical representation of the ideal human karyotype
Mitochondrial DNA .
Human genetic variation is the genetic differences both within and among populations .
There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human population ( genes ) , leading to polymorphism .
Many genes are not polymorphic , meaning that only a single allele is present in the population : the gene is then said to be fixed .
No two humans are genetically identical .
Even monozygotic twins , who develop from one zygote , have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during development and gene copy number variation .
Differences between individuals , even closely related individuals , are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting .
Alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations , with populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tending to differ more .
Causes of differences between individuals include the exchange of genes during meiosis and various mutational events .
There are at least two reasons why genetic variation exists between populations .
Natural selection may confer an adaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele provides a competitive advantage .
Alleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage .
The second main cause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most mutations .
Most mutations do not appear to have any selective effect one way or the other on the organism .
The main cause is genetic drift , this is the effect of random changes in the gene pool .
In humans , founder effect and past small population size ( increasing the likelihood of genetic drift ) may have had an important influence in neutral differences between populations .
The theory that humans recently migrated out of Africa supports this .
The study of human genetic variation has both evolutionary significance and medical applications .
It can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one another .
For medicine , study of human genetic variation may be important because some disease-causing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic regions .
New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parents .
Apart from mutations , many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans today .
For example , it is suspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are those that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes today .
what is the political tea party
Tea Party protesters on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall at the Taxpayer March on Washington on September 12 , 2009 .
The Tea Party movement is an American political movement that advocates strict adherence to the United States Constitution , reducing U.S. government spending and taxes , and reduction of the U.S. national debt and federal budget deficit .
The movement has been called partly conservative , partly libertarian , and partly populist .
The movement has sponsored protests and supported political candidates since 2009 .
The name of the movement is derived from the Boston Tea Party of 1773 , an iconic event in American history .
Anti-tax protesters in the United States have often referred to the original Boston Tea Party for inspiration .
References to the Boston Tea Party were part of Tax Day protests held throughout the 1990s and earlier .
By 2001 , a custom had developed among some conservative activists of mailing tea bags to legislators and other officials as a symbolic act .
what is puerto rico currency
The currencies of Puerto Rico closely follow the historic development of Puerto Rico .
As a colony of Spain and the United States , Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies .
Following the Spanish colonization in 1502 , Puerto Rico became an important port , with its own supply of gold .
However , as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century , the archipelago 's economy suffered .
The Spanish Crown issued the Situado Mexicano , which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain would be sent to the island , as a way to provide economic support .
Between 1636 and 1637 , Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp .
Inspired by this , Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766 , becoming the first colony to print 8- real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government 's approval of subsequent issues .
The situado was discontinued during the 19th century , creating an economic crisis , as a result of Mexico gaining its independence from Spain .
Salvador Meléndez Bruna , the colonial governor in office , ordered the issue of provincial banknotes , creating the Puerto Rican peso .
However , printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815 .
During the following decades , foreign coins became the widespread currency .
In the 1860s and 1870s , banknotes reemerged .
On February 1 , 1890 , the Banco Español de Puerto Rico was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes .
The bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under Spanish rule .
In 1895 , a Royal Decree ordered the production of provincial peso coins .
On August 13 , 1898 , the Spanish-American War ended with Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States .
The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills equivalent to the United States dollar , creating the Puerto Rican dollar .
In 1902 , the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner .
Two more series were issued until 1913 .
After Puerto Rico 's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States ' economic and monetary system , the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury .
The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues , including commemorative banknotes , private currency , and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face .
where was pepsi invented
Pepsi ( stylized in lowercase as pepsi , formerly stylized in uppercase as PEPSI ) is a carbonated soft drink that is produced and manufactured by PepsiCo .
Created and developed in 1893 and introduced as Brad 's Drink , it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28 , 1898 , then to Pepsi in 1961 .
who is ezekiel in the bible
The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible , following the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah and preceding the Book of the Twelve .
( The order is somewhat different in the Christian Old Testament ) .
It derives its name from , and records the visions of , the 6th century BC priest and prophet Ezekiel .
According to the book , the prophet , exiled in Babylon , experienced a series of seven visions during the 22 years from 593 to 571 BC , a period which spans the final destruction of Jerusalem in 586 .
The visions , and the book , are structured around three themes : ( 1 ) judgment on Israel ( chapters 1-24 ) ; ( 2 ) judgment on the nations ( chapters 25-32 ) ; and future blessings for Israel ( chapters 33-48 ) .

when was birth control banned in the united states
The National Birth Control League was a birth control organization in the United States .
It was founded in March 1915 by Mary Dennett , Clara Gruening Stillman and Jessie Ashley .
Its main purpose was to overturn the laws which banned contraceptives from the U.S. mails .
Campaigns were mounted in New York , but in 1919 the League was disbanded and reformed into the Voluntary Parenthood League .
what is the word for lung cancer ?
Cancer , known medically as a malignant neoplasm , is a broad group of various diseases , all involving unregulated cell growth .
In cancer , cells divide and grow uncontrollably , forming malignant tumors , and invade nearby parts of the body .
The cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream .
Not all tumors are cancerous .
Benign tumors do not grow uncontrollably , do not invade neighboring tissues , and do not spread throughout the body .
There are over 200 different known cancers that afflict humans .
Determining what causes cancer is complex .
Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer , including tobacco use , certain infections , radiation , lack of physical activity , obesity , and environmental pollutants .
These can directly damage genes or combine with existing genetic faults within cells to cause the disease .
Approximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary .
Cancer can be detected in a number of ways , including the presence of certain signs and symptoms , screening tests , or medical imaging .
Once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by microscopic examination of a tissue sample .
Cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy , radiation therapy and surgery .
The chances of surviving the disease vary greatly by the type and location of the cancer and the extent of disease at the start of treatment .
While cancer can affect people of all ages , and a few types of cancer are more common in children , the risk of developing cancer generally increases with age .
In 2007 , cancer caused about 13 % of all human deaths worldwide ( 7.9 million ) .
Rates are rising as more people live to an old age and as mass lifestyle changes occur in the developing world .
where was skiing originated

what was the main contribution of john maynard keynes made to economics
John Maynard Keynes , 1st Baron Keynes , CB , FBA ( ; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946 ) was a British economist whose ideas have fundamentally affected the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics , and informed the economic policies of governments .
He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles , and is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century .
His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics , as well as its various offshoots .
In many ways , subsequent developments in 20th century economics can be viewed as either building on Keynes ' ideas or reacting against them .
In the 1930s , Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking , overturning the older ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would , in the short to medium term , automatically provide full employment , as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands .
Keynes instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity , and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment .
He advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions .
Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Keynes 's ideas concerning economic policy were adopted by leading Western economies .
In 1942 , Keynes was awarded a hereditary peerage as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex .
Keynes died in 1946 , but during the 1950s and 1960s the success of Keynesian economics resulted in almost all capitalist governments adopting its policy recommendations .
Keynes 's influence waned in the 1970s , partly as a result of problems that began to afflict the Anglo-American economies from the start of the decade , and partly because of critiques from Milton Friedman and other economists who were pessimistic about the ability of governments to regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy .
However , the advent of the global financial crisis in 2007 caused a resurgence in Keynesian thought .
Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the crisis by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama of the United States , Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom , and other heads of governments .
In 1999 , Time magazine included Keynes in their list of the 100 most important and influential people of the 20th century , commenting that : `` His radical idea that governments should spend money they do n't have may have saved capitalism . ''
In addition to being an economist , Keynes was also a civil servant , a director of the British Eugenics Society , a director of the Bank of England , a patron of the arts and an art collector , a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals , an advisor to several charitable trusts , a writer , a philosopher , a private investor , and a farmer .
where are the ten commandments in the bible
This 1768 parchment ( 612×502 mm ) by Jekuthiel Sofer emulated the 1675 Ten Commandments at the Amsterdam Esnoga synagogue .
The Ten Commandments , also known as the Decalogue , are a set of biblical laws relating to ethics and worship , which play a fundamental role in Judaism , Islam and Christianity .
They include instructions to worship only God , to keep the sabbath holy and prohibitions against idolatry , blasphemy , murder , theft , deception and adultery .
Different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them .
The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Hebrew Bible , in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy .
According to the story in Exodus , God inscribed them on two stone tablets , which he gave to Moses on Mount Sinai .
Modern scholarship has found likely influences in Hittite and Mesopotamian laws and treaties , but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them .

The discography of the English alternative rock band The Smiths consists of four studio albums , one extended play ( EP ) , one live album , ten compilation albums , twenty singles , one video album and fourteen music videos on the Rough Trade , Sire and WEA record labels .
The band was formed in 1982 in Manchester by vocalist Morrissey , guitarist Johnny Marr , bass player Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce .
Despite being championed by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel , the band 's debut single , `` Hand in Glove `` ( May 1983 ) , failed to chart .
Its follow-up , `` This Charming Man `` ( October 1983 ) , met with critical acclaim and reached number twenty-five on the UK Singles Chart .
The Smiths ' cult status was followed by mainstream success in 1984 , as they reached number twelve in the UK with the `` What Difference Does It Make ? `` single and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart with their debut album , The Smiths ( 1984 ) .
Their next three singles all reached the top twenty of the charts in the UK , helping to consolidate their previous chart success .
The next studio album , Meat Is Murder ( 1985 ) , reached the top of the British charts ; however , the only single to be released from the album , `` That Joke Is n't Funny Anymore `` ( 1985 ) , failed to break the UK Top 40 .
Returning to form , The Smiths ' next six singles all reached the higher than number thirty in the UK and their third album , The Queen Is Dead ( 1986 ) , reached number two in the UK .
Despite the band 's chart success , Marr left the group in August 1987 due to a strained relationship with Morrissey .
Failing to find a replacement , The Smiths disbanded by the time their final studio album , Strangeways , Here We Come , was released in September that year .
Strangeways , Here We Come reached number two in the UK and became the band 's highest-charting release in the United States when it reached number fifty-five on the Billboard 200 .
In early 1992 , WEA acquired the entire back catalogue of The Smiths and produced two compilations – Best ... I and ... Best II – the first of which reached the top of the UK Albums Chart .
WEA released two further singles compilations in 1995 and 2001 , with a further compilation , The Sound of The Smiths , released in November 2008 .
who was the foreman in gone with the wind
Gone with the Wind is a novel written by Margaret Mitchell , first published in 1936 .
It is often placed in the literary sub-genre of the historical romance novel .
However , it has been argued the novel is a `` near miss '' and does not contain all of the elements of the romance genre , making it simply a historical novel .
The story is set in Clayton County , Georgia , and Atlanta during the American Civil War and Reconstruction .
It depicts the experiences of Scarlett O'Hara , the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner , who must use every means at her disposal to come out of the poverty she finds herself in after Sherman 's `` March to the Sea '' .
Margaret Mitchell began writing Gone with the Wind in 1926 to pass the time while recovering from an auto-crash injury that refused to heal .
In April 1935 , Harold Latham of Macmillan , an editor who was looking for new fiction , read what she had written and saw that it could be a best-seller .
After Latham agreed to publish the book , Mitchell worked for another six months checking the historical references , and rewrote the opening chapter several times .
Mitchell and her husband John Marsh , a copy editor by trade , edited the final version of the novel .
Mitchell wrote the book 's final moments first , and then wrote the events that led up to it .
As to what became of her lovers , Rhett and Scarlett , after the novel ended , Mitchell did not know , and said , `` For all I know , Rhett may have found someone else who was less difficult . ''
Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1937 .
The book was adapted into a 1939 American film .
Gone with the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime .
what is endodontic dentistry
Endodontics ( from the Greek endo `` inside '' ; and odons `` tooth '' ) is one of the dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association , Royal College of Dentists of Canada , and Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons , and deals with the tooth pulp and the tissues surrounding the root of a tooth .
Endodontists perform a variety of procedures including endodontic therapy ( commonly known as `` root canal therapy '' ) , endodontic retreatment , surgery , treating cracked teeth , and treating dental trauma .
Root canal therapy is one of the most common procedures .
If the pulp ( containing nerves , arterioles , venules , lymphatic tissue , and fibrous tissue ) becomes diseased or injured , endodontic treatment is required to save the tooth .
what is mini sas protocol
Serial Attached SCSI ( SAS ) is a point-to-point serial protocol that moves data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives .
SAS replaces the older Parallel SCSI ( pronounced `` scuzzy '' ) bus technology that first appeared in the mid-1980s .
SAS , like its predecessor , uses the standard SCSI command set .
SAS offers backward compatibility with second-generation SATA drives .
SATA 3 Gbit/s drives may be connected to SAS backplanes , but SAS drives can not connect to SATA backplanes .
The T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards ( INCITS ) develops and maintains the SAS protocol ; the SCSI Trade Association ( SCSITA ) promotes the technology .
What is the legal definition of `` natural born citizen '' ?
Part of the constitutional provision as it appeared in 1787
Status as a natural-born citizen of the United States is one of the eligibility requirements established in the United States Constitution for election to the office of President or Vice President .
This requirement was intended to protect the nation from foreign influence .
The Constitution does not define the phrase natural-born citizen , and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning .
A 2011 Congressional Research Service report stated
The natural-born-citizen clause has been mentioned in passing in several decisions of the United States Supreme Court and lower courts dealing with the question of eligibility for citizenship by birth , but the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question of a specific presidential or vice-presidential candidate 's eligibility as a natural-born citizen .

who was the commander of UN forces in Korea
The United Nations Command ( UNC ) is the unified command structure for the multinational military forces supporting the Republic of Korea ( South Korea or ROK ) during and after the Korean War .
After troops of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea or DPRK ) invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 82 calling on North Korea to cease hostilities and withdraw to the 38th parallel .
On June 27 , 1950 , it adopted Resolution 83 , recommending that members of the United Nations provide assistance to the Republic of Korea `` to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security to the area '' .
Security Council Resolution 84 , adopted on July 7 , 1950 , recommended that members providing military forces and other assistance to South Korea `` make such forces and other assistance available to a unified command under the United States of America '' .
Although the resolutions suggested the forces under the UNC were `` United Nations forces '' , and United Nations itself could be considered a belligerent , in practice the United Nations exercised no control over the combat forces , which were controlled by the United States .
Most observers concluded that the forces under the UNC were not in law United Nations troops , and the acts of the UNC were not the acts of the United Nations .
The UNC can be regarded as an alliance of national armies , operating under the collective right of self-defense .
On August 29 , 1950 , the British Commonwealth 's 27th Infantry Brigade arrived at Busan to join the UNC , which until then included only ROK and U.S. forces .
The 27th Brigade moved into the Naktong River line west of Daegu .
Troop units from other countries of the UN followed in rapid succession ; Australia , Belgian United Nations Command , Canada , Colombia , Ethiopia , France , Greece , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , New Zealand , the Philippines , Thailand and Turkey .
The Union of South Africa provided air units which fought alongside the air forces of other member nations .
Denmark , India , Norway , and Sweden provided medical units .
Italy provided a hospital , even though it was not a UN member .
The United Nations Command and the Chinese-North Korean Command signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 , ending the heavy fighting .
The armistice agreement established the Military Armistice Commission ( MAC ) , consisting of representatives of the two signatories , to supervise the implementation of the armistice terms .
The North Korean-Chinese MAC has been replaced by Panmumjon Representatives under exclusive North Korean management .
Regular meetings have been stopped , although duty officers of Joint Security Area , commonly known as the Truce Village of Panmunjom , from each side meet regularly .

what is Christian Protestant ?
A Christian denomination is an identifiable religious body under a common name , structure , and doctrine within Christianity .
In the Orthodox tradition , churches are divided often along ethnic and linguistic lines , into separate churches and traditions .
Technically , divisions between one group and another are defined by doctrine and church authority .
Issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , eschatology , and papal primacy separate one denomination from another .
The Roman Catholic Church is the largest denomination with over 1.1 billion members , over half of all Christians worldwide , making it the largest denomination for any religion worldwide ( although the church does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church ) .
Protestant denominations comprise roughly 38–39 % of Christians worldwide , and together the Catholics , Protestants , Anglicans , and other closely related denominations comprise Western Christianity .
The Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East are considered Eastern Christian denominations .
Western Christian denominations prevail in Western Europe and its former colonies .
Eastern Christian denominations are represented mostly in Eastern Europe , the Middle East and North Africa .
Christians have various doctrines about the Church , the body of faithful that they believe was established by Jesus Christ , and how the divine church corresponds to Christian denominations .
Both the Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox consider each of themselves solely to faithfully represent the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church to the exclusion of the other .
Protestants separated from the Catholic Church because of theologies and practices that they considered to be in violation of their interpretation .
Generally , members of the various denominations acknowledge each other as Christians , at least to the extent that they have mutually recognized baptisms and acknowledge historically orthodox views including the Divinity of Jesus and doctrines of sin and salvation , even though doctrinal and ecclesiological obstacles hinder full communion between churches .
Since the reforms surrounding Vatican II , the Catholic Church has referred to Protestant communities as `` denominations '' , while reserving the term `` church '' for apostolic churches , including the Eastern Orthodox ( see subsistit in and branch theory ) .
There are however some non-denominational Christians who do not follow any particular branch .
where are Giant Panda Bears found ?
The panda ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca , lit .
`` black and white cat-foot '' ) , also known as the giant panda to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda , is a bear native to central-western and south western China .
It is easily recognized by the large , distinctive black patches around its eyes , over the ears , and across its round body .
Though it belongs to the order Carnivora , the panda 's diet is 99 % bamboo .
Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses , wild tubers , or even meat in the form of birds , rodents or carrion .
In captivity , they may receive honey , eggs , fish , yams , shrub leaves , oranges , or bananas along with specially prepared food .
The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China , mainly in Sichuan province , but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces .
As a result of farming , deforestation and other development , the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived .
The panda is a conservation reliant endangered species .
A 2007 report shows 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country .
Wild population estimates vary ; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild , while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000 .
Some reports also show that the number of pandas in the wild is on the rise .
However , the IUCN does not believe there is enough certainty yet to reclassify the species from Endangered to Vulnerable .
While the dragon has often served as China 's national emblem , internationally the panda appears at least as commonly .
As such , it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts , for example the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics .

The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events , from the fall of the monarchy in Afghanistan through the Soviet military intervention , the mass exodus of Afghan refugees to Pakistan and the United States , and the Taliban regime .
Though most of the film is set in Afghanistan , these parts were mostly shot in Kashgar , China , due to the dangers of filming in Afghanistan at the time .

The child actors are native speakers , but several adult actors had to learn Dari .
Filming wrapped up on December 21 , 2006 , and the film was expected to be released on November 2 , 2007 .
However , after concern for the safety of the young actors in the film due to fears of violent reprisals to the sexual nature of some scenes in which they appear , its release date was pushed back six weeks to December 14 , 2007 .
The Kite Runner was released on DVD on March 25 , 2008 .
A HD DVD release was announced for the same date , but was canceled following the format 's demise .
The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007 .
The film 's score by Alberto Iglesias was nominated for Best Original Score at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards .
where is marijuana legal
The legality of cannabis varies from country to country .
Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s .
However , many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis , particularly in North America , South America and Europe .
Furthermore , possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law , which governs persons in all states .
The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries , including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel .
While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis , enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law ; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime , also contrary to federal statute .
Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but , apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana , most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe .
Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation , use , possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use .
A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis , making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment .
Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users , with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes .
There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada .
Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs .
However , simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries , particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution .

when was coca cola invented
The Las Vegas Strip World of Coca-Cola museum in 2003
Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores , restaurants , and vending machines in every country except Cuba and North Korea .
It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta , Georgia , and is often referred to simply as Coke ( a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27 , 1944 ) .
Originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton , Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler , whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century .
The company produces concentrate , which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world .
The bottlers , who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company , produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners .
The bottlers then sell , distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores and vending machines .
Such bottlers include Coca-Cola Enterprises , which is the largest single Coca-Cola bottler in North America and western Europe .
The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains to major restaurants and food service distributors .

In musical notation , a bar ( or measure ) is a segment of time defined by a given number of beats , each of which are assigned a particular note value .
Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pin point locations within a piece of music .
It also makes written music easier to follow , since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch .
Typically , a piece consists of several bars of the same length , and in modern musical notation the number of beats in each bar is specified at the beginning of the score by the top number of a time signature ( such as 3/4 ) , while the bottom number indicates the note value of the beat ( the beat has a quarter note value in the 3/4 example ) .
The word bar is more common in British English , and the word measure is more common in American English , although musicians generally understand both usages .
In American English , although the words bar and measure are often used interchangeably the correct use of the word 'bar ' refers only to the vertical line itself , while the word 'measure ' refers to the beats contained between bars .
In international usage , it is equally correct to speak of bar numbers and measure numbers , e.g . ‘bars 9–16’ or ‘mm . 9–16’ .
Along the same lines , it is wise to reserve the abbreviated form ‘bb .
3–4’ etc . for beats only ; bars should be referred to by name in full .
The first metrically complete measure within a piece of music is called ‘bar 1’ or ‘m . 1’ .
When the piece begins with an anacrusis ( an incomplete measure at the head of a piece of music ) , ‘bar 1’ or ‘m . 1’ is the following measure .
what is the main source of power in today 's america factories ?
The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day .
Solar energy , radiant light and heat from the sun , has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies .
Solar energy technologies include solar heating , solar photovoltaics , solar thermal electricity , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis , which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent energy problems the world now faces .
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute solar energy .
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy .
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air .
In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits .
It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating climate change , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise .
These advantages are global .
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared '' .
what is primary medicine
Primary care may be provided in community health centres .
Primary care is the health care given by a health care provider .

Reproductive health , therefore , implies that people are able to have a responsible , satisfying and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if , when and how often to do so .
One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods of birth control ; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual , reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant .
On the other hand individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services .
Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status , education level , age , ethnicity , religion , and resources available in their environment .
It is possible for example , that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health .
According to the WHO , `` Reproductive and sexual ill-health accounts for 20 % of the global burden of ill-health for women , and 14 % for men . ''

when was the first super bowl
The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the highest level of professional American football in the United States , culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year .
The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game , rather than the year in which it is held .
For example , Super Bowl I was played on January 15 , 1967 , following the 1966 regular season , while Super Bowl XLVII was played on February 3 , 2013 , following the 2012 season .
The game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its then-rival league , the American Football League ( AFL ) .
It was agreed that the two leagues ' champion teams would play in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970 .
After the merger , each league was redesignated as a `` conference `` , and the game was then played between the conference champions .
Currently , the National Football Conference ( NFC ) leads the series with 25 wins to 22 wins for the American Football Conference ( AFC ) .
The day on which the Super Bowl is played , now considered by some a de facto American national holiday , is called `` Super Bowl Sunday `` .
It is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption , after Thanksgiving Day .
In addition , the Super Bowl has frequently been the most watched American television broadcast of the year .
Super Bowl XLV , played in 2011 , became the most-watched American television program in history , drawing an average audience of 111 million viewers and taking over the spot held by the previous year 's Super Bowl , which itself had taken over the # 1 spot held for twenty-eight years by the final episode of M*A*S*H .
The Super Bowl is also among the most watched sporting events in the world , almost all being North American audiences , and is second to association football ’s UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide .
Because of its high viewership , commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year .
Due to the high cost of investing in advertising on the Super Bowl , companies regularly develop their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast .
As a result , watching and discussing the broadcast 's commercials has become a significant aspect of the event .
In addition , many popular singers and musicians have performed during the event 's pre-game and halftime ceremonies because of the exposure .
what is the origin of fiona
Fiona is a feminine given name .
The name Fiona was invented , and first used , by the Scottish poet James Macpherson ( 1736–96 ) , author of the Ossian poems , which he claimed were translations from ancient Gaelic sources ( sources , when challenged , he never produced ) .
The name was subsequently used as a pseudonym by William Sharp ( 1855–1905 ) , who authored several romantic works under the name `` Fiona Macleod '' .
The name has since become popular in England , Scotland and Ireland .
The name is considered to be a Latinised form of the Gaelic word fionn , meaning `` white '' , `` fair '' .
The name Fiona is also sometimes used as an Anglicisation of the Irish-language name Fíona , although these names are otherwise unrelated ( as Fíona is derived from an element meaning `` vine '' ) .
There is also a modern tendency to equate the authentic Scottish Gaelic feminine name Fionnghal with Fiona .
The name Fiona is rising in popularity particularly in German -speaking countries .
Fiona was the 49th most popular name for baby girls born in 2008 in Germany .
Fiona was tied for third place in the ranking of most popular names for baby girls born in the tiny principality of Liechtenstein in 2008 .
The name was the 347th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 2008 , where it has ranked among the top 1,000 most popular names for girls since 1990 and among the top 500 since 1999 .

what is the official language of america ?
Many languages are used , or historically have been used in the United States .
The most commonly used language is English .
There are also many languages indigenous to North America or to U.S. states or holdings in the Pacific region .
Languages brought to the country by colonists or immigrants from Europe , Asia , or other parts of the world make up a large portion of the languages currently used ; several languages , including creoles and sign languages , have also developed in the United States .
Approximately 337 languages are spoken or signed by the population , of which 176 are indigenous to the area .
Fifty-two languages formerly spoken in the country 's territory are now extinct .
The variety of English spoken in the United States is known as American English .
English is the de facto national language of the United States , with 80 % of the population claiming it as a mother tongue , and some 95 % claiming to speak it `` well '' or `` very well '' .
However , no official language exists at the federal level .
There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills , but none of these bills has become law with the amendment intact .
The situation is quite varied at the state and territorial levels , with some states mirroring the federal policy of adopting no official language in a de jure capacity , others adopting English alone , others officially adopting English as well as local languages , and still others adopting a policy of de facto bilingualism .
Spanish is the second most common language in the country , and is spoken by over 12 % of the population .
The United States holds the world 's fifth largest Spanish-speaking population , outnumbered only by Mexico , Spain , Colombia , and Argentina .
Throughout the Southwestern United States , long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants .
Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English , nearly all second-generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently , while only about half still speak Spanish .
According to the 2000 US census , people of German ancestry make up the largest single ethnic group in the United States , and the German language ranks fifth .
Italian , Polish , and French are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century , but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die .
Russian is also spoken by immigrant populations .
Tagalog and Vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the United States , almost entirely within recent immigrant populations .
Both languages , along with the varieties of the Chinese language , Japanese , and Korean , are now used in elections in Alaska , California , Hawaii , Illinois , New York , Texas , and Washington .
Native American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country , but these populations are decreasing , and the languages are almost never widely used outside of reservations .
Hawaiian , although having few native speakers , is an official language along with English at the state level in Hawaii .
The state government of Louisiana offers services and documents in French , as does New Mexico in Spanish .
Besides English , Spanish , French , German , Navajo and other Native American languages , all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of education .
what is auto quarter panel
1990 's Pontiac Grand Am Sedan fender and quarter panel
On an automobile , a quarter panel ( or rear wing as it is known in British English ) is usually considered the body panel which goes between the rear door and the trunk and typically wraps around the wheel well ; however , the similar front section Fender ( vehicle ) , between the door and the hood , is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a quarter panel .
The quarter panel is typically made of Sheet metal , but is sometimes made of fiberglass or fiber-reinforced plastic ; although , this varies with different makes and models .
A quarter panel is typically a welded on component of the uni-body structure or Monocoque .
Replacement of a sheet metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded ( or sometimes bonded ) to the Vehicle .
Due to this high amount of specialized labor , a quarter panel may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering out the damage , and a body filler sometimes referred to as bondo to be applied to finalize the original surface .

what is vat tax ?
A value added tax ( VAT ) is a form of consumption tax .
From the perspective of the buyer , it is a tax on the purchase price .
From that of the seller , it is a tax only on the value added to a product , material , or service , from an accounting point of view , by this stage of its manufacture or distribution .
The manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts , and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs .
The value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer , minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs .
A VAT is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed .
It differs from the sales tax in that , with the latter , the tax is collected and remitted to the government only once , at the point of purchase by the end consumer .
With the VAT , collections , remittances to the government , and credits for taxes already paid occur each time a business in the supply chain purchases products .
what is high sticking in hockey
A referee calling a high-sticking penaltyHigh
-sticking is the name of two infractions in the sport of ice hockey that may occur when a player intentionally or inadvertently plays with his or her stick above the height of the shoulders or above the cross bar of a hockey goal .
This can result in a stoppage of play or in a penalty .
In the rules of the National Hockey League , high-sticking is defined as a penalty in Rule 60 and as a non-penalty foul in Rule 80 .
A stoppage in play results if a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the team who touched it regains control of the puck .
However , play usually continues if a player touches the puck with a high stick and the opposing team gains control of the puck .
If the puck goes into the opposing net after coming into contact with a high stick , the goal is disallowed .
The level at which a stick is considered too high for a goal is the crossbar of the net .
However , if a player knocks the puck into his own net with a high stick , the goal is allowed .
A penalty is assessed if a player strikes another player with a high stick .
The player is given a minor penalty unless his high stick caused an injury , in which case the referee has the option to assess a double-minor , major or match penalty .
It is the referee 's discretion which penalty to assess : the rule calls for a double minor for an accidental injury , or a match penalty for a deliberate attempt to injure ( whether the opposition player was actually injured ) .
Injury is usually decided by the high stick causing bleeding , but the presence of blood does not automatically mean an extra penalty is awarded .
Some referees have been known to award an extra penalty without the presence of blood if the referee determines that the injury sustained was sufficient to warrant a double-minor penalty .

Some printers and personal computers have a built-in card reader .
A multi card reader is used for communication with more than one type of flash memory card .
Multi card readers do not have built-in memory capacity , but are able to accept multiple types and styles of memory cards .
The number of compatible memory cards varies from reader to reader and can include more than 20 different types .
The number of different memory cards that a multi card reader can accept is expressed as x-in-1 , with x being a figure of merit indicating the number of memory cards accepted , such as 35-in-1 .
There are three categories of card readers sorted by the type and quantity of the card slots : single card reader ( e.g . 1x SD-only ) , multi card reader ( e.g . 9-in-1 ) and series card reader ( e.g . 4x SD only ) .

when was the trogan war
In Greek mythology , the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus king of Sparta .
The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature , most notably through Homer 's Iliad and the Odyssey .
The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes Odysseus 's journey home .
Other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments .
Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature , and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid .
The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena , Hera , and Aphrodite , after Eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the Apple of Discord , marked `` for the fairest '' .
Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris , who judged that Aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple .
In exchange , Aphrodite made Helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus , fall in love with Paris , who took her to Troy .
Agamemnon , king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus , led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris ' insult .
After the deaths of many heroes , including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax , and the Trojans Hector and Paris , the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse .
The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath .
Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .
The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas , one of the Trojans , who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern-day Italy .
The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC , and believed that Troy was located in modern-day Turkey near the Dardanelles .
By modern times , both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical .
In 1868 , however , the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert , who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over Calvert 's excavations on property belonging to Calvert ; this claim is now accepted by most scholars .
Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question .
Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age .
Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC , often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes , 1194–1184 BC , which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa .
what is the anarchy symbol called
Anarchists have employed certain symbols for their cause , including most prominently the circle-A and the black flag , although anarchists have historically largely denied the importance of symbols to political movement .
Since the revival of anarchism around the start of the 21st-century concurrent with the rise of the anti-globalization movement , anarchist cultural symbols are widely present .

what is the lowest temperature ever recorded in antarctica
Surface temperature of Antarctica in winter and summer from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
The climate of Antarctica is the coldest on the whole of Earth .
Antarctica has the lowest naturally occurring temperature ever recorded on the ground on Earth : −89.2 °C ( −128.6 °F ) at Vostok Station .
It is also extremely dry ( technically a desert ) , averaging 166 mm ( 6.5 in ) of precipitation per year .
Even so , on most parts of the continent the snow rarely melts and is eventually compressed to become the glacial ice that makes up the ice sheet .
Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent .
Most of Antarctica has an ice cap climate ( Köppen EF ) with very cold , generally extremely dry weather throughout the year and no month averaging above 0 °C ( 32 °F ) .
Some fringe coastal areas have a tundra climate ( Köppen ET ) with a short summer averaging above freezing , and much higher precipitation .

When Is Passover Over
Passover , or Pesach ( from : in Hebrew , Yiddish ) , Tiberian : , Modern Hebrew : /ˈpesaχ/ Pesah , Pesakh , Yiddish : Peysekh , Paysakh , Paysokh ) is an important Biblically -derived Jewish festival .
Historically , together with Shavuot ( `` Pentecost '' ) and Sukkot ( `` Tabernacles '' ) , Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals ( Shalosh Regalim ) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem .
Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim , but only men participate in public worship .
Passover commences on the 15th of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts for either seven days ( in Israel ) or eight days ( in the diaspora ) .
In Judaism , a day commences at dusk and lasts until the following dusk , thus the first day of Passover only begins after dusk of the 14th of Nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the month of Nisan .
The rituals unique to the Passover celebrations commence with the Passover Seder when the 15th of Nisan has begun .
In the Northern Hemisphere Passover takes place in spring as the Torah prescribes it : `` in the month of [ the ] spring '' ( בחדש האביב ) .
It is one of the most widely observed Jewish holidays .
The Jewish people celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation over 3,300 years ago by God from slavery in ancient Egypt that was ruled by the Pharaohs , and their birth as a nation under the leadership of Moses .
It commemorates the story of the Exodus as described in the Hebrew Bible especially in the Book of Exodus , in which the Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt .
In the narrative of the Exodus , the Bible tells that God helped the Children of Israel escape from their slavery in Egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves ; the tenth and worst of the plagues was the death of the Egyptian first-born .
The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and , upon seeing this , the spirit of the Lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes , hence the name of the holiday .
There is some debate over where the term is actually derived from .
When the Pharaoh freed the Israelites , it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise ( leaven ) .
In commemoration , for the duration of Passover no leavened bread is eaten , for which reason it is called `` The Festival of the Unleavened Bread '' .
Thus Matzo ( flat unleavened bread ) is eaten during Passover and it is a symbol of the holiday .
when is halley 's comet next
Halley 's Comet or Comet Halley ( or ) , officially designated 1P/Halley , is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years .
Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth , and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime .
Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular , but will appear only once in thousands of years .
Halley 's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BCE .
Clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by Chinese , Babylonian , and medieval European chroniclers , but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time .
The comet 's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley , after whom it is now named .
Halley 's Comet last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 .
During its 1986 apparition , Halley became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft , providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation .
These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction , particularly Fred Whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' model , which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water , carbon dioxide and ammonia – and dust .
The missions also provided data which substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance it is now understood that Halley 's surface is largely composed of dusty , non-volatile materials , and that only a small portion of it is icy .
what is the term used to describe a period o high anti- Communist feelings in the US
Anti-communism is opposition to communism .
Organized anti-communism developed in reaction to the rise of communism , especially after the 1917 October Revolution in Russia and reaching global dimensions during the Cold War .
Most anti-communists reject the concept of historical materialism , which is a central idea in Marxism .
Anti-communists reject the Marxist belief that capitalism will be followed by socialism and communism , just as feudalism was followed by capitalism .
Anti-communists question the validity of the Marxist claim that the socialist state will `` wither away '' when it becomes unnecessary in a true communist society .
Anti-communists argue that the repression in the early years of Bolshevik rule , while not as extreme as that during Joseph Stalin 's rule , was still severe by reasonable standards , citing examples such as Felix Dzerzhinsky 's secret police , which eliminated numerous political opponents by extrajudicial executions , and the brutal crushing of the Kronstadt rebellion and Tambov rebellion .
Some anti-communists refer to both Communism and fascism as totalitarianism , seeing similarity between the actions of communist and fascist governments .
Historian Robert Conquest has argued that Communism was responsible for tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century .
Opponents argue that Communist parties that have come to power have tended to be rigidly intolerant of political opposition .
These opponents claim that most Communist countries have shown no signs of advancing from Marx 's socialist stage of economy to an ideal communist stage .
Rather , Communist governments have been accused of creating a new ruling class ( a Nomenklatura ) , with powers and privileges greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classes in the non- communist regimes .

what is soy made from
The soybean ( US ) or soya bean ( UK ) ( Glycine max ) is a species of legume native to East Asia , widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses .
The plant is classed as an oilseed rather than a pulse by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) .
Fat-free ( defatted ) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many prepackaged meals ; soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop .
For example , soybean products such as textured vegetable protein ( TVP ) are ingredients in many meat and dairy analogues .
Soybeans produce significantly more protein per acre than most other uses of land .
Traditional nonfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk , and from the latter tofu and tofu skin .
Fermented foods include soy sauce , fermented bean paste , natto , and tempeh , among others .
The oil is used in many industrial applications .
The main producers of soy are the United States ( 35 % ) , Brazil ( 27 % ) , Argentina ( 19 % ) , China ( 6 % ) and India ( 4 % ) .
The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid , alpha-linolenic acid , and isoflavones .

what is rationalism by john locke george berkeley
George Berkeley ( ; 12 March 168514 January 1753 ) , also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ) , was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called `` immaterialism '' ( later referred to as `` subjective idealism `` by others ) .
This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers , and as a result can not exist without being perceived .
Thus , as Berkeley famously put it , for physical objects `` esse est percipi '' ( `` to be is to be perceived `` ) .
Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism .
In 1709 , Berkeley published his first major work , , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects , but light and colour .
This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710 which , after its poor reception , he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713 .
In this book , Berkeley 's views were represented by Philonous ( Greek : 'lover of mind ' ) , while Hylas ( Greek : 'matter ' ) embodies the Irish thinker’s opponents , in particular John Locke .
Berkeley argued against Sir Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu ( on Motion ) , published 1721 .
His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein .
In 1732 , he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734 , he published The Analyst , an empiricist critique of the foundations of infinitesimal calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics .
His last major philosophical work , Siris ( 1744 ) , begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water , and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics including science , philosophy , and theology .
Interest in Berkeley 's work increased after World War II , because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century such as the problems of perception , the difference between primary and secondary qualities , and the importance of language .

what is crohn 's and colitis
Crohn 's disease , also known as Crohn syndrome and regional enteritis , is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus , causing a wide variety of symptoms .
It primarily causes abdominal pain , diarrhea ( which may be bloody if inflammation is at its worst ) , vomiting ( can be continuous ) , or weight loss , but may also cause complications outside the gastrointestinal tract such as skin rashes , arthritis , inflammation of the eye , tiredness , and lack of concentration .
Crohn 's disease is caused by interactions between environmental , immunological and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals .
This results in a chronic inflammatory disorder , in which the body 's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens .
Crohn 's disease has wrongly been described as an autoimmune disease in the past ; recent investigators have described it as an immune deficiency state .
There is a genetic association with Crohn 's disease , primarily with variations of the NOD2 gene and its protein , which senses bacterial cell walls .
Siblings of affected individuals are at higher risk .
Males and females are equally affected .
Smokers are two times more likely to develop Crohn 's disease than nonsmokers .
Crohn 's disease affects between 400,000 and 600,000 people in North America .
Prevalence estimates for Northern Europe have ranged from 27–48 per 100,000 .
Crohn 's disease tends to present initially in the teens and twenties , with another peak incidence in the fifties to seventies , although the disease can occur at any age .
There is no known pharmaceutical or surgical cure for Crohn 's disease .
Treatment options are restricted to controlling symptoms , maintaining remission , and preventing relapse .
The disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn , who , in 1932 , together with two other colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , described a series of patients with inflammation of the terminal ileum , the area most commonly affected by the illness .

what is compatible with directx 9.0b
Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for handling tasks related to multimedia , especially game programming and video , on Microsoft platforms .
Originally , the names of these APIs all began with Direct , such as Direct3D , DirectDraw , DirectMusic , DirectPlay , DirectSound , and so forth .
The name DirectX was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs ( the X standing in for the particular API names ) and soon became the name of the collection .
When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console , the X was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology .
The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool ( XACT ) , while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite .
Direct3D ( the 3D graphics API within DirectX ) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Xbox , Microsoft Xbox 360 and some Sega Dreamcast games .
Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering .
As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX , it is common to see the names `` DirectX '' and `` Direct3D '' used interchangeably .
The DirectX software development kit ( SDK ) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form , along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding .
Originally , the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user .
Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX , but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 .
Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX , as has every version of Windows released since .
The SDK is available as a free download .
While the runtimes are proprietary , closed-source software , source code is provided for most of the SDK samples .
Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview , DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK .
Direct3D 9Ex , Direct3D 10 , and Direct3D 11 are only available for Windows Vista and newer because each of these new versions was built to depend upon the new Windows Display Driver Model that was introduced for Windows Vista .
The new Vista/WDDM graphics architecture includes a new video memory manager supporting virtualization of graphics hardware for various applications and services like the Desktop Window Manager .

who was more heroic gilgamesh or enkidu
The Epic of Gilgamesh , an epic poem from Mesopotamia , is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature .
The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five independent Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh ' ( Sumerian for Gilgamesh ) , king of Uruk .
Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian .
This first combined epic , known as the `` Old Babylonian '' version , dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Shūtur eli sharrī ( `` Surpassing All Other Kings '' ) .
Only a few fragments of it have survived .
The later `` Standard Babylonian '' version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru ( `` He who Saw the Deep '' ) .
Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer , twelve-tablet version have been recovered .
Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal .
The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu .
Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh 's equal to distract him from oppressing the people of Uruk .
Together , they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian .
Later they kill the Bull of Heaven , which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances .
As a punishment for these actions , the gods sentence Enkidu to death .
The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh 's distress at Enkidu 's death , and his quest for immortality .
In order to learn the secret of eternal life , Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey .
He learns that `` The life that you are seeking you will never find .
When the gods created man they allotted to him death , but life they retained in their own keeping . ''
This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic , and then attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic .
Nevertheless , Gilgamesh 's fame lived on after his death , because of his great building projects , and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood .
The story has been translated into many different languages , and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction .
what is the first video game ever
There are numerous debates over who created the first video game , with the answer depending largely on how video games are defined .
The evolution of video games represents a tangled web of several different industries , including scientific , computer , arcade , and consumer electronics .
The `` video '' in `` video game `` traditionally refers to a raster display device .
With the popular catch phrase use of the term `` video game '' , the term now implies all display types , formats , and platforms .
Historians have also sought to bypass the issue by instead using the more specific `` digital games '' descriptive .
This term leaves out the earlier analog-based computer games .

what is windows data protection data
Data Execution Prevention ( DEP ) is a security feature included in modern operating systems .
It is known to be available in Linux , Mac OS X , iOS , Microsoft Windows and Android operating systems and is intended to prevent an application or service from executing code from a non-executable memory region .
This helps prevent certain exploits that store code via a buffer overflow , for example .
DEP runs in two modes : hardware-enforced DEP for CPUs that can mark memory pages as nonexecutable , and software-enforced DEP with limited protection for CPUs that do not have hardware support .
Software-enforced DEP does not protect against execution of code in data pages , but instead counters SEH overwrite , another type of attack .
DEP was introduced on Linux in 2004 ( kernel 2.6.8 ) , on Windows in 2004 with Windows XP Service Pack 2 , while Apple introduced DEP when they moved to x86 in 2006 .
what is futanaria
Example illustration of two common futanari variants
, is the Japanese word for hermaphroditism , which is also used in a broader sense for androgyny .
Beyond Japan the term is used to describe a commonly pornographic genre of computer games , comics and animations , which includes characters that show both primary sexual characteristics .
But in today 's language it refers almost exclusively for characters who have an overall feminine appearance .
In that case the term is also often abbreviated as futa ( s ) , which is occasionally also used as term for the works itself .
what is captcha code
Early CAPTCHAs such as these , generated by the EZ-Gimpy program , were used on Yahoo !
A modern CAPTCHA , rather than attempting to create a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text , might focus on making segmentation difficult by adding an angled line .
Another way to make segmentation difficult is to crowd symbols together , as in Yahoo ! 's current CAPTCHA format .
Some CAPTCHAs try to utilize the ability of people to see three-dimensional objects .
On this image , symbols are drawn with lines of different thickness to make an effect of extrusion .
A CAPTCHA ( ) is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a human being .
The process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete a simple test which the computer is able to grade .
These tests are designed to be easy for a computer to generate but difficult for a computer to solve , but again easy for a human .
If a correct solution is received , it can be presumed to have been entered by a human .
A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen .
Such tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites , since a normal human can easily read a CAPTCHA , while the bot can not process the image letters and therefore , can not answer properly , or at all .
Although most CAPTCHAs are letter pictures randomly generated , many of them have become difficult even for a human to read , so picture CAPTCHAs were created in which a human is shown a simple test to show a picture of a certain animal ( given few animal pictures ) , which is simple for a human being to process , and therefore easy to pick , while a bot can not process and solve the question because although it can analyze the picture , it can not easily guess the animal .
The term `` CAPTCHA '' was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn , Manuel Blum , Nicholas J. Hopper , and John Langford ( all of Carnegie Mellon University ) .
It is an acronym based on the word `` capture '' and standing for `` Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart '' .
Carnegie Mellon University attempted to trademark the term on 15 October 2004 , but the trademark application was abandoned on 21 April 2008 .
A CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test , because it is administered by a machine and targeted at a human , in contrast to the standard Turing test that is typically administered by a human and targeted at a machine .

Where is the greatest concentration of KFC in the world
KFC ( Kentucky Fried Chicken ) is a fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville , Kentucky , United States , which specializes in fried chicken .
An `` American icon '' , it is the world 's second largest restaurant chain overall ( as measured by sales ) after McDonald 's , with over 18,000 outlets in 120 countries and territories .
The company is a subsidiary of Yum !
Brands , a restaurant company which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell .
KFC was founded by Harland Sanders , who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin , Kentucky during the Great Depression .
Sanders was one of the first people to see the potential of the restaurant franchising concept , with the first `` Kentucky Fried Chicken '' franchise opening in Utah in 1952 .
The franchise popularized chicken in the fast food industry , thereby diversifying the market and challenging the dominance of the hamburger .
Marketing himself as `` Colonel Sanders '' , he became a legendary figure of American cultural history , and his image is still prominently used in KFC branding .
The company 's rapid expansion saw it grow too large for Sanders to manage , and in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y . Brown , Jr. and Jack Massey .
KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally , opening outlets in England , Mexico and Puerto Rico by the mid-1960s .
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , KFC experienced mixed fortunes domestically , as it went through a series of corporate owners who had little or no experience in the restaurant business .
In the early 1970s , KFC was sold to the spirits firm Heublein , who were taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate , who sold the chain to PepsiCo .
The chain continued to expand overseas however , and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China .
The chain has since expanded rapidly in China , and the country is now the company 's most profitable market .
PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants , which later changed its name to Yum !
Brands .
KFC primarily sells fried chicken pieces and variations such as chicken sandwiches and wraps , salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw , desserts and soft drinks , often supplied by PepsiCo .
Its most famous product is pressure fried chicken pieces , seasoned with Sanders ' `` Original Recipe '' of 11 herbs and spices .
The exact nature of these ingredients is unknown , and represents a notable trade secret .
Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a distinctive cardboard `` bucket '' , which has become a signature of the chain since being introduced by franchisee Pete Harman .
KFC is famous for the slogan `` finger lickin ' good '' , which has since been replaced by `` Nobody does chicken like KFC '' and `` So good '' .
what is phylum cnidaria
Cnidaria ( with a silent c ) or Coelenterata is a phylum containing over 10,000 species of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environments .
Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes , specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey .
Their bodies consist of mesoglea , a non-living jelly-like substance , sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick .
They have two basic body forms : swimming medusae and sessile polyps , both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes .
Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration .
Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids , or both .
Cnidarians ' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors .
Several free-swimming Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts , and some have simple eyes .
Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually .
Many have complex lifecycles with asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae , but some omit either the polyp or the medusa stage .
Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata , but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla .
Cnidarians are classified into four main groups : the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa ( sea anemones , corals , sea pens ) ; swimming Scyphozoa ( jellyfish ) ; Cubozoa ( box jellies ) ; and Hydrozoa , a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms , and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o ' War .
Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa , and there is debate about whether Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are cnidarians or closer to bilaterians ( more complex animals ) .
Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves , but many obtain much of their nutrition from endosymbiotic algae , and a few are parasites .
Many are preyed upon by other animals including starfish , sea slugs , fish and turtles .
Coral reefs , whose polyps are rich in endosymbiotic algae , support some of the world 's most productive ecosystems , and protect vegetation in tidal zones and on shorelines from strong currents and tides .
While corals are almost entirely restricted to warm , shallow marine waters , other cnidarians live in the depths , in polar seas and in freshwater .
Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about , and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before and diversified a few million years later .
Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rare .
Scientists currently think that cnidarians , ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges , and that anthozoans are the evolutionary `` aunts '' or `` sisters '' of other cnidarians , and the most closely related to bilaterians .
Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians , although considered more `` primitive '' than bilaterians , have a wider range of genes .
what is the meaning of word aztecs
The Aztec Pyramid at St. Cecilia Acatitlan , Mexico State .
Aztec jade mask depicting the god Xipe Totec .
Large ceramic statue of an Aztec Eagle Warrior
Aztec cosmogram in the pre-Hispanic Codex Fejérváry-Mayer - the fire god Xiuhtecuhtli is in the center .
The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico , particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries .
The Nahuatl words aztecatl ( singular ) and aztecah ( plural ) mean `` people from Aztlan `` , a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time , and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people .
Often the term `` Aztec '' refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan ( now the location of Mexico City ) , situated on an island in Lake Texcoco , who referred to themselves as Mexica Tenochca or Cōlhuah Mexica .
Sometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan 's two principal allied city-states , the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan , who together with the Mexica formed the Aztec Triple Alliance which controlled what is often known as `` the Aztec Empire '' .
In other contexts , Aztec may refer to all the various city states and their peoples , who shared large parts of their ethnic history and cultural traits with the Mexica , Acolhua and Tepanecs , and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca .
In this meaning it is possible to talk about an Aztec civilization including all the particular cultural patterns common for most of the peoples inhabiting Central Mexico in the late postclassic period .
From the 13th century , the Valley of Mexico was the heart of Aztec civilization : here the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance , the city of Tenochtitlan , was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco .
The Triple Alliance formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico , conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica .
At its pinnacle , Aztec culture had rich and complex mythological and religious traditions , as well as reaching remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments .
In 1521 Hernán Cortés , along with a large number of Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies , conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec Triple Alliance under the leadership of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II .
Subsequently the Spanish founded the new settlement of Mexico City on the site of the ruined Aztec capital , from where they proceeded with the process of colonizing Central America .
Aztec culture and history is primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the renowned Templo Mayor in Mexico City ; from indigenous bark paper codices ; from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Hernán Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo ; and especially from 16th and 17th century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language , such as the famous Florentine Codex compiled by the Franciscan monk Bernardino de Sahagún with the help of indigenous Aztec informants .

what is standard deviation in statistics
A plot of a normal distribution ( or bell-shaped curve ) where each band has a width of 1 standard deviation – See also : 68-95-99.7 rule
Cumulative probability of a normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1 .
In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation ( represented by the symbol sigma , σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ) , or expected value .
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean ; high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values .
The standard deviation of a random variable , statistical population , data set , or probability distribution is the square root of its variance .
It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation .
A useful property of standard deviation is that , unlike variance , it is expressed in the same units as the data .
Note , however , that for measurements with percentage as unit , the standard deviation will have percentage points as unit .
In addition to expressing the variability of a population , standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions .
For example , the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times .
The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval .
In science , researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data , and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation .
Standard deviation is also important in finance , where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment .
When only a sample of data from a population is available , the standard deviation of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the `` sample standard deviation '' .
When the sample is the entire population , its unmodified standard deviation is called the `` population standard deviation '' .
what is melloco entero
Ulluco ( u : ju : kɔ : ) ( Ullucus tuberosus ) is a plant grown primarily as a root vegetable , secondarily as a leaf vegetable .
The ulluco is one of the most widely grown and economically important root crops in the Andean region of South America , second only to the potato .
It is known there with the common name of papa lisa , but also by the regional names melloco ( Ecuador ) , olluco ( Peru ) , chugua ( Colombia ) or ruba ( Venezuela ) , among others .
The leaf and the tuber are edible , similar to spinach and the potato , respectively .
They are known to contain high levels of protein , calcium , and carotene .
Papalisa were used by the Incas prior to arrival of Europeans in South America .
Ulluco tubers are marketed as `` Earth Gems '' in New Zealand , by Halfords Exotic Produce .

where was the fugitive slave law made
An April 24 , 1851 poster warning the `` colored people of Boston '' about policemen acting as slave catchers .
The Fugitive Slave Law or Fugitive Slave Act was passed by the United States Congress on September 18 , 1850 , as part of the Compromise of 1850 between Southern slave-holding interests and Northern Free-Soilers .
This was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a `` slave power conspiracy '' .
It declared that all runaway slaves were , upon capture , to be returned to their masters .
Abolitionists nicknamed it the `` Bloodhound Law '' for the dogs that were used to track down runaway slaves .

what is eic earned income credit
The United States federal earned income tax credit or earned income credit ( EITC or EIC ) is a refundable tax credit for low- and medium-income individuals and couples , primarily for those who have qualifying children .
When the credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed , it results in a tax refund to those who claim the credit .
This credit is provided to offset the burden of social security taxes and also to promote an incentive to work .
In order for a person or couple to claim one or more persons as their qualifying child ( ren ) , the age , relationship , and shared residency requirements must be met , as well as some other requirements .
U.S. tax forms 1040EZ , 1040A , or 1040 can be used to claim EIC without qualifying children .
To claim the credit with qualifying children , 1040A or 1040 must be used , as well as attaching Schedule EIC .
EIC phases in slowly , has a medium-length plateau , and then phases out more slowly than it phased in .
Since the credit phases out at 21 % ( for two children and for three or more qualilfying children ) or 16 % ( for one qualifying child ) , it is always preferable to have one more dollar of actual salary or wages ( although technically , since the EIC table moves by fifty dollar increments , it 's always preferable to have an extra fifty-dollar increment of salary or wages ) .
For tax year 2011 , the maximum EIC for a single person or couple filing without qualifying children was $ 464 .
The maximum EIC with one qualifying child was $ 3,094 , with two children was $ 5,112 , and with three or more qualifying children was $ 5,751 .
These amounts are indexed annually for inflation .
The earned income tax credit has been part of political debates in the United States regarding whether raising the minimum wage or increasing EIC will better address a seeming shortage of good-paying jobs .

what is lifespan development in psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of changes that occur in human beings over the course of their life span .
Originally concerned with infants and children , the field has expanded to include adolescence , adult development , aging , and the entire life span .
This field examines change across a broad range of topics including motor skills and other psycho-physiological processes ; cognitive development involving areas such as problem solving , moral understanding , and conceptual understanding ; language acquisition ; social , personality , and emotional development ; and self-concept and identity formation .
Developmental psychology includes issues such as the extent to which development occurs through the gradual accumulation of knowledge versus stage-like development , or the extent to which children are born with innate mental structures versus learning through experience .
Many researchers are interested in the interaction between personal characteristics , the individual 's behavior , and environmental factors including social context , and their impact on development ; others take a more narrowly-focused approach .
Developmental psychology informs several applied fields , including : educational psychology , child psychopathology , and forensic developmental psychology .
Developmental psychology complements several other basic research fields in psychology including social psychology , cognitive psychology , ecological psychology , and comparative psychology .
where is the person who played `` joey stivic '' in all in the family
Joseph Michael `` Joey '' Stivic is a fictional character who first appeared on the 1970s American sitcom All in the Family .
Joey Stivic was the son and only child of Mike Stivic ( played by Rob Reiner ) and Gloria Stivic ( played by Sally Struthers ) , and the grandson of Archie Bunker ( Carroll O'Connor ) and Edith Bunker ( Jean Stapleton ) .
The character first appeared as a newborn baby in a two-part episode of All in the Family which aired in December 1975 .
After many appearances on All in the Family until Reiner and Struthers left the series in 1978 ( by that time , Joey had been played most often by alternating twins Jason and Justin Draeger ) , the Joey Stivic character next appeared on the All in the Family spin-off series ( some call it a continuation of the original ) Archie Bunker 's Place in a guest appearance in the November 1979 episode `` Thanksgiving Reunion . ''
In this instance , the character was played by child actor Dick Billingsley and was appropriately pre-school age .
With Gloria now separated from Mike , she returned to Archie Bunker 's Place with Joey in the February 1982 episode `` Gloria Comes Home . ''
In this episode , Joey was played by Christopher Johnston .
Joey Stivic was a regular character on the All in the Family spin-off series Gloria in 1982 and 1983 .
On this series , in which the now-divorced Gloria Bunker character had moved to Upstate New York in order to work as an assistant veterinarian , the part of Joey Stivic was played by ten-year-old actor Christian Jacobs .
After Gloria was canceled in 1983 , Joey Stivic disappeared from prime time television for 11 years , until the character made one last appearance on 704 Hauser , a short-lived 1994 series about a black family who had moved into the old Bunker home , years after Bunker had sold it .
In this appearance , the Joey Stivic character was played by Casey Siemaszko , an actor born in 1961 ( 14 years before Joey Stivic 's fictional birth ) .
In 1976 the Ideal Toy Company released a 14-inch `` Joey Stivic doll '' ( called `` Archie Bunker 's Grandson '' ) which was billed as the `` first anatomically correct male doll . ''
The doll inspired mild controversy at the time , and is a collectors ' item today .
when is rose bowl game in 2012

when was the Declaration of Independence Signing
The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 , which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states , and no longer a part of the British Empire .
Instead they now formed a new nation—the United States of America .
John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence , which was unanimously approved on July 2 .
A committee had already drafted the formal declaration , to be ready when congress voted on independence .
Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which congress would edit to produce the final version .
The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War .
The national birthday , the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4 , although Adams wanted July 2 .
After ratifying the text on July 4 , Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms .
It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public .
The most famous version of the Declaration , a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence , is displayed at the National Archives in Washington , D.C .
Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4 , the date of its signing was August 2 .
The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have been derived from this original document .
The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry .
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III , and by asserting certain natural and legal rights , including a right of revolution .
Having served its original purpose in announcing independence , the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution .
Since then , it has come to be considered a major statement on human rights , particularly its second sentence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
This has been called `` one of the best-known sentences in the English language '' , containing `` the most potent and consequential words in American history . ''
The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive .
This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln , who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy , and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted .
It has inspired work for the rights of marginalized people throughout the world .

who was the president in 1960
The United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 8 , 1960 .
The Republican Party nominated incumbent Vice-President Richard Nixon , while the Democratic Party nominated John F. Kennedy , Senator from Massachusetts .
The incumbent President , Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower , was not eligible for re-election after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the Twenty-second Amendment .
Kennedy was elected with a lead of 112,827 votes , or 0.17 % of the popular vote , giving him a victory of 303 to 219 in the Electoral College , the closest since 1916 .
This was the first election in which all fifty of the current United States participated .
A number of factors explain why the election was so close .
Kennedy gained since there was an economic recession which hurt the incumbent Republican , and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans .
Furthermore , the new votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among Protestants .
Kennedy 's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon 's .
In the end , Nixon 's emphasis on his experience carried little weight , and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states .
Kennedy used his large , well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination , secure endorsements , and , with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses , to get out the vote in the big cities .
He relied on running mate Lyndon B. Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively .
This election is notable as being the first time in U.S. history that two sitting U.S . Senators ( Kennedy and Johnson ) were elected as president and vice-president , a phenomenon that has been repeated once , by Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008 ( in both cases , the president was the younger , more junior senator ) .

when was the patriot act enacted
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of the U.S. Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26 , 2001 .
The title of the act is a ten letter acronym ( USA PATRIOT ) that stands for Uniting ( and ) Strengthening America ( by ) Providing Appropriate Tools Required ( to ) Intercept ( and ) Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 .
The act , as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th , significantly reduced restrictions in law enforcement agencies ' gathering of intelligence within the United States ; expanded the Secretary of the Treasury’s authority to regulate financial transactions , particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities ; and broadened the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts .
The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism , thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act’s expanded law enforcement powers can be applied .
On May 26 , 2011 , President Barack Obama used an Autopen to sign the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 , a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act while he was in France : roving wiretaps , searches of business records ( the `` library records provision `` ) , and conducting surveillance of `` lone wolves '' — individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups .
Republican leaders questioned if the use of the Autopen met the constitutional requirements for signing a bill into law .

Dave Matthews Band ( DMB ) is an American rock band that was formed in Charlottesville , Virginia , United States , in 1991 .
The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews , bassist Stefan Lessard , drummer /backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore .
Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed .
Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident .
GRAMMY Award -winner Jeff Coffin of Béla Fleck and the Flecktones has since filled Moore 's spot as the band 's saxophonist .
Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full-time touring members of the band .
The band 's 2009 album Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King ( the first album since Moore 's death ) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , earning the band their fifth consecutive number-one debut— making them the second band behind Metallica to do so .
Their most recent album , Away from the World , was released in 2012 , and also debuted at number one on the Billboard chart .
As of 2010 , the Dave Matthews Band has sold over 30 million records worldwide .
The band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe , featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs , accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show .
This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s .
After twenty consecutive years of touring the band announced that it would take the summer of 2011 off .
Dave Matthews Band has won one GRAMMY Award , and was awarded the NAACP Chairman 's Award .
According to Julian Bond , `` they sell out the largest arenas on Earth , but frequently give their music away . ''
what is transcendental wild oats about
Transcendental Wild Oats : A Chapter from an Unwritten Romance is a prose satire written by Louisa May Alcott , about her family 's involvement with the Transcendentalist community Fruitlands in the early 1840s .
The work was first published in a New York newspaper in 1873 , and reprinted in 1874 , 1876 , and 1915 and after .
In her account , Alcott provides the real people involved with thin pseudonymous disguises .
Her father Amos Bronson Alcott is `` Abel Lamb , '' while his partner and community co-founder Charles Lane is `` Timon Lion ; '' Abigail May Alcott , Louisa 's mother and Bronson 's wife , is `` Sister Hope . ''
Alcott depicts her father as dominated by his more forceful partner , and both men as feckless and impractical dreamers .
The men of the community spend their time in pointless debates while Sister Hope works from dawn to dusk to maintain their existence .
A crisis arises at harvest time , when the grain crop is threatened by an approaching storm .
In Alcott 's words , `` About the time the grain was ready to house , some call of the Oversoul wafted all the men away . ''
Sister Hope organizes the only available help , three little girls and a boy , and manages to save the crop .
The little community collapses as soon as the weather turns cold , when it becomes clear that their provisions are too meager to last the coming winter .
Timon Lion and his son abscond to join the Shakers — though Timon is unhappy to learn that life among them is `` all work and no play . ''
Abel is crushed by the failure of the enterprise ; after days of despair he begins to eat again only when he realizes that his family needs him .
Sister Hope finds a way for them to subsist and persevere .
Alcott 's view of male arrogance and female exploitation in this piece is paralleled in her novel , published in the same year as `` Transcendental Wild Oats . ''
`` Transcendental Wild Oats '' has been reprinted in several modern editions .
who was the first person to climb the mount of the holy cross
Mount of the Holy Cross is the northernmost 14,000-foot mountain in the Sawatch Range , part of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado .
It is located in the Holy Cross Wilderness near the ghost town of Holy Cross City and in Eagle County .
It was named for the distinctive cross-shaped snowfield on the northeast face .
Under USDA Forest Service administration , the mountain was proclaimed `` Holy Cross National Monument '' by Herbert Hoover on May 11 , 1929 .
The monument was transferred to the National Park Service in 1933 .
In 1950 , it was returned to the Forest Service and lost its National Monument status—the number of visitors to the mountain and the nearby `` Pilgrim 's Hut '' had waned , and the expense of full-time staff could not be justified .
This mountain has been the subject of painters , photographers and even a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , ( The Cross of Snow ) .
The first publicly available photograph was published in National Geographic magazine .
Thomas Moran depicted the mountain in an oil painting , which now is part of the collection of the Museum of the American West , part of the Autry National Center in Los Angeles , California .
It is still much photographed but it is not as well known today as it was in the past .
Nearby features include Bowl of Tears Lake , directly under the east face of the peak , Tuhare Lakes , in a cirque that lies south of a significant subpeak , and several other lakes .
Notable locations within include the Dotsero volcano ( near Interstate 70 ) , Vail and Aspen .
US 24 runs near the peak through Gilman .
Photochrom print of Mount of the Holy Cross c. 1900 .
This image is a reversed view of the mountain compared to how it actually appears .
The first recorded ascent of Holy Cross was in 1873 , by F. V. Hayden and photographer W. H. Jackson during one of Hayden 's geographical surveys .
However , the peak may well have been ascended previously by miners or American Indians .
The first winter ascent of the peak was made in 1943 by Russel Keene and Howard Freedman of the 10th Mountain Division , then stationed at Camp Hale .
Holy Cross can be climbed by at least four different routes , with the easiest and most common route being the North Ridge , which involves of vertical gain over and is rated YDS Class 2 for moderate scrambling .
The Cross Couloir route forms the vertical portion of the famous cross feature , and provides an advanced snow climb or extreme ski descent .
Mount of the Holy Cross has a history of endangering the lives of many hikers .
Primarily , the hikers who require rescue are unfamiliar with the risks of entering wilderness areas and do not bring adequate equipment and supplies to respond to emergency conditions .
Although the summit on Mount of the Holy Cross is frequently reached on a long day hike , unprepared hikers are frequently stranded or lost due to changing environmental conditions and confusion regarding the surrounding landscape , especially on the descent of North Ridge .
Thorough research and reasonable planning should prevent most tragedies .
Mount of the Holy cross is accessible from Tigiwon Road , south of Minturn , Colorado .
The Half Moon Pass Trail is the standard route to the summit of Mount of the Holy Cross via the North Ridge .
Following the Fall Creek Trail to an ascent of Notch Mountain Trail provides the best view of the Holy Cross snow feature from Notch Mountain Ridge .
what is a gsm cell phone
The GSM logo is used to identify compatible handsets and equipment
GSM ( Global System for Mobile Communications , originally ' ) , is a standard set developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) to describe protocols for second generation ( 2G ) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones .
It became the de facto global standard for mobile communications with over 80 % market share .
The GSM standard was developed as a replacement for first generation ( 1G ) analog cellular networks , and originally described a digital , circuit switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony .
This was expanded over time to include data communications , first by circuit switched transport , then packet data transport via GPRS ( General Packet Radio Services ) and EDGE ( Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution or EGPRS ) .
Further improvements were made when the 3GPP developed third generation ( 3G ) UMTS standards followed by fourth generation ( 4G ) LTE Advanced standards .

what was the cash and carry lend lease
President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs the Lend-Lease bill to give aid to Britain and China ( 1941 )
The Lend Lease act was an act where the United States had supported its allies .
Lend-Lease ( ) was the law that started a program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom , the USSR , Republic of China , Free France , and other Allied nations with materiel between 1941 and 1945 .
It was signed into law on March 11 , 1941 , a year and a half after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939 .
This was nine months before the U.S. entered the war in December 1941 .
Formally titled An Act to Further Promote the Defense of the United States , the Act effectively ended the United States ' pretense of neutrality .
A total of $ 50 .1 billion ( equivalent to $ today ) worth of supplies were shipped : $ 31.4 billion to Britain , $ 11.3 billion to the Soviet Union , $ 3.2 billion to France , $ 1.6 billion to China , and smaller sums to other Allies .
Reverse Lend-Lease comprised services such as rent on air bases that went to the U.S. , and totaled $ 7.8 billion ; of this , $ 6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth .
The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until time for their return or destruction .
Supplies after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for £1 .075 billion using long-term loans from the United States .
Canada operated a similar program that sent $ 4.7 billion in supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union .
The United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation .
This program was a decisive step away from non-interventionist policy , which had dominated United States foreign relations since the end of World War I , towards international involvement .

what is older pyramid or stonehedge
Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire , England , about west of Amesbury and north of Salisbury .
One of the most famous sites in the world , Stonehenge is the remains of a ring of standing stones set within earthworks .
It is in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England , including several hundred burial mounds .
Archaeologists believe it was built anywhere from 3000 BC to 2000 BC .
Radiocarbon dating in 2008 suggested that the first stones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC , whilst another theory suggests that bluestones may have been raised at the site as early as 3000 BC .
The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch , which constitute the earliest phase of the monument , have been dated to about 3100 BC .
The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO 's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 in a co-listing with Avebury Henge .
It is a national legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument .
Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage , while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust .
Archaeological evidence found by the Stonehenge Riverside Project in 2008 indicates that Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings .
The dating of cremated remains found on the site indicate that deposits contain human bone from as early as 3000 BC , when the ditch and bank were first dug .
Such deposits continued at Stonehenge for at least another 500 years .
The site is a place of religious significance and pilgrimage in Neo-Druidry .
who was in the women 's ncaa 1994 final four
The NCAA Women 's Division I Championship is an annual college basketball tournament for women .
Held each April , the Women 's Championship was inaugurated in the 1981–82 season .
The NCAA tournament was preceded by the AIAW Women 's Basketball Tournament , which was held annually from 1972 to 1982 .
Basketball was one of twelve women 's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981-82 school year , as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women 's collegiate sports .
The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve ( and other ) sports ; however , after a year of dual women 's championships , the NCAA prevailed , while the AIAW disbanded .
Attendance and interest in the Women 's Division I Championship have grown over the years , especially since 2003 , when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men 's championship game .
The women 's championship game is now the final overall game of the college basketball season .
Before that , the Women 's Final Four was usually played on the Friday before the Men 's Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament .
The final was usually played the Sunday afternoon following the Men 's Final Four .
The tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference , which receive automatic bids .
The remaining slots are at-large bids , with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee .
The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors , including team rankings , win-loss records and Ratings Percentage Index ( RPI ) data .
Unlike the men 's tournament , there are only 32 at-large bids ( as of the next tournament in 2014 ) , and no play-in game .
The women 's tournament , like the men 's , is staged in a single elimination format , and is part of the media and public frenzy known colloquially as March Madness or The Big Dance .
All 63 games have been broadcast on television since 2003 on ESPN and ESPN2 .
Similar to the pre-2011 men 's tournament coverage on CBS , local teams are shown on each channel when available , with `` whip-around '' coverage designed to showcase the most competitive contests in the rest of the country .
where is the rosetta stone located in 2010
The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum
The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V .
The decree appears in three scripts : the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs , the middle portion Demotic script , and the lowest Ancient Greek .
Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts ( with some minor differences between them ) , it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs .
Originally displayed within a temple , the stone was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period and eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid ( Rosetta ) in the Nile Delta .
It was rediscovered there in 1799 by a soldier , Pierre-François Bouchard , of the French expedition to Egypt .
As the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times , the Rosetta Stone aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this hitherto untranslated ancient language .
Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars .
Meanwhile , British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801 , and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria .
Transported to London , it has been on public display at the British Museum since 1802 .
It is the most-visited object in the British Museum .
Ever since its rediscovery , the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries , including its transfer from French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars , a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young 's and Champollion 's contributions to the decipherment , and since 2003 , demands for the stone 's return to Egypt .
Study of the decree was already under way as the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803 .
It was 20 years , however , before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822 ; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently .
Major advances in the decoding were : recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text ( 1799 ) ; that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names ( 1802 ) ; that the hieroglyphic text did so as well , and had pervasive similarities to the demotic ( Thomas Young , 1814 ) ; and that , in addition to being used for foreign names , phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words ( Champollion , 1822–1824 ) .
Two other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later , and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known , including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees ( the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC , and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV , ca . 218 BC ) .
The Rosetta Stone is therefore no longer unique , but it was the essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilization .
The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge .
where are poison dart frog seen
Poison dart frog ( also dart-poison frog , poison frog or formerly poison arrow frog ) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to Central and South America .
These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies .
Although all wild dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic , levels of toxicity vary considerably from one species to the next and from one population to another .
Many species are threatened .
These amphibians are often called `` dart frogs '' due to the Amerindians ' indigenous use of their to poison the tips of blowdarts .
However , of over 175 species , only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ) , all of which come from the Phyllobates genus , which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members .
what is cajeta in english
Cajeta is a Mexican confection of thickened syrup usually made of sweetened caramelised milk .
According to chef Rick Bayless , the name for cajeta came from the Spanish phrase al punto de cajeta , which means `` a liquid thickened to the point at which a spoon drawn through the liquid reveals the bottom of the pot in which it is being cooked '' .
Another hypothesis is that it takes its name from the small wooden boxes in which it was traditionally packed .
Mexican cajeta is considered a specialty of the city of Celaya in the state of Guanajuato , although it is also produced with the traditional method in several towns of the state of Jalisco , such as Mazamitla , Sayula , and Atotonilco el Alto .
Cajeta is made by simmering goat 's milk , or occasionally a sweetened liquid , stirring frequently , until it becomes very viscous due to evaporation of water , and caramelized .
While goat milk is the most usual base , other liquids or juices may be used .
In Celaya , and eventually the rest of Mexico , the confection of half goat 's milk and half cow 's milk became known by the name cajeta , but elsewhere , the milk candy became known as leche quemada , dulce de leche , etc .
It has cousins in the many Indian milk-based sweets like pera and the milk fudge burfi , and in the opera fudge of the U.S. Cajeta is eaten on its own as a sweet , as a spread or filling for breads and pastries , such as churros , and as a topping for ice cream .
Certain liquors are added to special recipes called cajeta envinada .
In addition , cajeta envinada especial is enriched with raisins , almonds , pecans or nuts .
Often it is used as a topping for crêpes , as a sweet sauce boiled and softened down with milk to soak the crepes , resulting in a tasty dessert .
In Mexico many brands make cajeta but the most common brand is Coronado .
It is also very common to place cajeta between obleas to make a traditional Mexican dessert .

where is rogers headquarters
Rogers Building , the headquarters of Rogers Communications
Rogers Communications Inc. is a diversified public Canadian communications and media company .
It is particularly in the field of wireless communications , cable television , telephone , and Internet connectivity with significant additional telecommunications and mass media assets .
The company is headquartered in the Rogers Building in Toronto , Ontario .
The company claims the heritage of the Rogers Vacuum Tube Company , founded in 1925 by Edward Rogers , which started the CFRB radio station in Toronto , which was later acquired by outside interests .
The present enterprise dates to 1960 , when Rogers ' son , Ted Rogers , founded Rogers Radio Broadcasting Ltd .
That company acquired CHFI that year , as well as Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting , a partnership with Joel Aldred which helped launch CFTO in 1961 .
Rogers later bought out Aldred and started the current cable and wireless operations , known as Rogers Cablesystems Ltd .
The chief competitor to the company is Bell Canada , which has a similarly extensive portfolio of radio and television media assets , as well as wireless , television distribution , and telephone services , particularly in Eastern and Central Canada ; the two companies are often seen as having a duopoly on communications services in their regions .
However , the company also competes nationally with Telus for wireless services , and primarily indirectly with Shaw Communications for television service .
The company also competes with a number of other media companies in the broadcasting industry .
what is the server for the internet
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to serve billions of users worldwide .
It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private , public , academic , business , and government networks , of local to global scope , that are linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless and optical networking technologies .
The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) and the infrastructure to support email .
Most traditional communications media including telephone , music , film , and television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) and Internet Protocol television ( IPTV ) .
Newspaper , book and other print publishing are adapting to Web site technology , or are reshaped into blogging and web feeds .
The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking .
Online shopping has boomed both for major retail outlets and small artisans and traders .
Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries .
The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication via computer networks .
The funding of a new U.S. backbone by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial backbones , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks .
The commercialization of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life .
, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world 's human population —have used the services of the Internet ; approximately 100 times more people than were using it in 1995 , when it was mostly used by tech-savvy middle and upper class people in the United States and several other countries .
The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage ; each constituent network sets its own policies .
Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet , the Internet Protocol address space and the Domain Name System , are directed by a maintainer organization , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) .
The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ( IPv4 and IPv6 ) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) , a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise .

what is the normal inr range
The prothrombin time ( PT ) and its derived measures of prothrombin ratio ( PR ) and international normalized ratio ( INR ) are measures of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation .
This test is also called `` ProTime INR '' and `` PT/INR '' .
They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood , in the measure of warfarin dosage , liver damage , and vitamin K status .
PT measures factors I ( fibrinogen ) , II ( prothrombin ) , V , VII , and X .
It is used in conjunction with the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) which measures the intrinsic pathway .
what is the meaning behind the song Moody 's , Im In the Mood ?
`` I 'm in the Mood for Love '' is a popular song .
The music was written by Jimmy McHugh , the lyrics by Dorothy Fields .
The song was published in 1935 .
It was introduced by Frances Langford in the movie Every Night at Eight released that year .
The song was featured in the 1936 Our Gang ( Little Rascals ) short , The Pinch Singer , sung by Carl `` Alfalfa '' Switzer , and in the 1936 film Palm Springs .
It is often known to be Switzer 's signature song .
James Moody 's saxophone solo on a 1952 recording of this song inspired the song `` Moody 's Mood for Love `` .
Hip hop artist Prince Paul sampled the song as the basis for the track `` Mood for Love '' on his album A Prince Among Thieves ( 1999 ) , with Don Newkirk singing its original lyrics .
The song 's title inspired the English title of Wong Kar Wai 's movie In the Mood for Love .
What is the value of understanding cross-cultural psychology ?
Cross-cultural psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes , including both their variability and invariance , under diverse cultural conditions .
Through expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior , language , and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology .
Since psychology as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America , some psychologists became concerned that constructs accepted as universal were not as invariant as previously assumed , especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying success .
Since there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central themes , such as affect , cognition , conceptions of the self , and issues such as psychopathology , anxiety , and depression , may lack external validity when `` exported '' to other cultural contexts , cross-cultural psychology re-examines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural variance .
Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology , cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences ( variance ) occur , rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry .
In 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology ( IACCP ) was established .
This branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies .
Cross-cultural psychology is differentiated from Cultural psychology .
The latter is the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is significantly influenced by cultural differences , meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a very limited extent .
In contrast , cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes .
Walter J. Lonner , writing for Eye on Psi Chi , has stated that `` cross-cultural psychology can be thought of as a type research methodology , rather than an entirely separate field within psychology ( 2000 ) . ''
when was the lady gaga judas song released
`` Judas '' is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga , from her second studio album Born This Way ( 2011 ) .
It was released by Interscope Records on April 15 , 2011 , four days ahead of its scheduled release .
Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne , `` Judas '' is a dance and electro house song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her .
It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past , and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she ca n't escape .
Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one 's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light .
The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word .
In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups , the song was generally well received by critics , who likened the song to `` Bad Romance `` with some noting it should have been the album 's lead single .
The song has a similar sound to Gaga 's previous RedOne-produced tracks , including `` Poker Face `` , `` LoveGame `` , `` Bad Romance '' , and `` Alejandro `` .
It contains three distinct hooks and a house -influenced break down .
Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption , regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be .
`` Judas '' initially had a strong sales opening , but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga 's previous singles .
The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets , and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea .
A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011 , co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus .
It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene .
The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem .
It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus , and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death .
Before its release , the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the alleged use of religious imagery and her role in the video .
However , critics generally praised the video , not finding any offensive content .
The video was nominated for two awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards .
Gaga has performed `` Judas '' on a number of television shows , including The Graham Norton Show , Saturday Night Live , Good Morning Americas `` Summer Concert Series '' , the French X Factor as well as on The Ellen DeGeneres Show .
what is mpeg4 avc or sp/asp
H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 or AVC ( Advanced Video Coding ) is a standard for video compression , and is currently one of the most commonly used formats for the recording , compression , and distribution of high definition video .
The final drafting work on the first version of the standard was completed in May 2003 .
H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is a block-oriented motion-compensation -based codec standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group ( VCEG ) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group ( MPEG ) .
The project partnership effort is known as the Joint Video Team ( JVT ) .
The ITU-T H.264 standard and the ISO/IEC MPEG-4 AVC standard ( formally , ISO/IEC 14496-10 – MPEG-4 Part 10 , Advanced Video Coding ) are jointly maintained so that they have identical technical content .
H.264 is perhaps best known as being one of the codec standards for Blu-ray Discs ; all Blu-ray Disc players must be able to decode H.264 .
It is also widely used by streaming internet sources , such as videos from Vimeo , YouTube , and the iTunes Store , web software such as the Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight , and also various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial ( ATSC , ISDB-T , DVB-T or DVB-T2 ) , cable ( DVB-C ) and satellite ( DVB-S and DVB-S2 ) .
WHAT IS NON BINDING ?
Non-binding arbitration is a type of arbitration in which the arbitrator makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute , but this determination is not binding upon them , and no enforceable arbitration award is issued .
The `` award '' is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator 's view of the respective merits of the parties cases .
Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement .
The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is , on the surface , similar to that of a mediator in a mediation .
However , the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at , the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and , if appropriate , an indication of the quantum of damages payable .
Subsequent to a non-binding arbitration , the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts , or by way of a binding arbitration , although in practice a settlement is the most common outcome .
The award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal .
Non-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the United States and Canada .
It is largely unknown in Europe , although in the United Kingdom there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a Queen 's Counsel for an opinion on the merits and likely quantum of a claim , and then to negotiate on the basis of the views expressed in that opinion .

when was alaska a state
Alaska ( ) is a state in the United States , situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent , with the international boundary with Canada to the east , the Arctic Ocean to the north , and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south , with Russia further west across the Bering Strait .
Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area , the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States .
Approximately half of Alaska 's 731,449 residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area .
Alaska 's economy is dominated by the oil , natural gas , and fishing industries ; it has these resources in abundance .
Alaska was purchased from Russia on March 30 , 1867 , for $ 7.2 million ( $ adjusted for inflation ) at approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) .
The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized ( or incorporated ) territory on May 11 , 1912 , and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3 , 1959 .
The name `` Alaska '' ( Аляска ) was already introduced in the Russian colonial period , when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq , meaning `` the mainland '' or , more literally , `` the object towards which the action of the sea is directed '' .
It is also known as Alyeska , the `` great land '' , an Aleut word derived from the same root .

what is darwin 's origin of species
On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859 , is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology .
Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life .
For the sixth edition of 1872 , the short title was changed to The Origin of Species .
Darwin 's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection .
It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution .
Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research , correspondence , and experimentation .
Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology .
There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public , but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England , while science was part of natural theology .
Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique , unrelated to other animals .
The political and theological implications were intensely debated , but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream .
The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication .
As Darwin was an eminent scientist , his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific , philosophical , and religious discussion .
The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H . Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism .
Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution , with a branching pattern of common descent , had occurred , but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate .
During the `` eclipse of Darwinism `` from the 1880s to the 1930s , various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit .
With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s , Darwin 's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory , now the unifying concept of the life sciences .
What is the name of the late Major League old professor
Charles Dillon `` Casey '' Stengel ( ; July 30 , 1890 – September 29 , 1975 ) , nicknamed `` The Old Perfessor '' , was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and manager .
He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in .
Stengel was born in Kansas City , Missouri , and originally nicknamed `` Dutch '' , a common nickname at that time for Americans of German ancestry .
After his major league career began , he acquired the nickname `` Casey '' , which originally came from the initials of his hometown ( `` K. C. '' ) , which evolved into `` Casey '' , influenced by the wide popularity of the poem Casey at the Bat .
In the 1950s , sportswriters dubbed him with yet another nickname , `` The Old Professor '' ( or `` Perfessor '' ) , for his sharp wit and his ability to talk at length on anything baseball -related .
Although his baseball career spanned a number of teams and cities , he is primarily associated with clubs in New York City .
Between playing and managing , he is the only man to have worn four of New York 's major league clubs ' uniforms .
He was the first of four men ( through the season ) to manage both the New York Yankees and New York Mets ; Yogi Berra , Dallas Green , and Joe Torre are the others .
Like Torre , he also managed the Braves and the Dodgers .
He ended his baseball career as the beloved manager for the then expansion New York Mets , which won over the hearts of New York partly due to the unique character of their veteran leader .
What is June known for ?
June ( ) is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and one of the four months with a length of 30 days .
Ovid provides two etymologies for June 's name in his poem concerning the months entitled the Fasti .
The first is that the month is named after the Roman goddess Juno , wife of Jupiter and equivalent to the Greek goddess Hera ; the second is that the name comes from the Latin word iuniores , meaning `` younger ones , '' as opposed to maiores ( `` elders '' ) for which the preceding month May may be named ( Fasti VI.1–88 ) .
See : Months in various calendars also called the season of the June is the month with the longest daylight hours of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest daylight hours of the year in the Southern Hemisphere .
June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa .
In the Northern hemisphere , the beginning of the meteorological summer is 1 June .
In the Southern hemisphere , the beginning of the meteorological winter is 1 June .
At the start of June , the sun rises in the constellation of Taurus ; at the end of June , the sun rises in the constellation of Gemini .
However , due to the precession of the equinoxes , June begins with the sun in the astrological sign of Gemini , and ends with the sun in the astrological sign of Cancer .
June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month .
According to one etymology , June is named after Juno ( Hera ) .
Juno was the goddess of marriage and a married couple 's household , so some consider it good luck to be married in this month .
According to another etymology provided by the Roman poet Ovid , June is named for the iuniores , latin for `` young people '' ( Fasti VI.88 ) and that the month of May is named for the maiores , Latin for `` elders '' .
In Iceland , folklore says that if you bathe naked in the morning dew on the morning of June 24 , you are supposed to keep aging at bay for longer .
when was the constitution written
A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed .
These rules together make up , i.e . constitute , what the entity is .
When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents , those documents may be said to embody a written constitution ; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document , it is said to embody a codified constitution .
Constitutions concern different levels of organizations , from sovereign states to companies and unincorporated associations .
A treaty which establishes an international organization is also its constitution , in that it would define how that organization is constituted .
Within states , whether sovereign or federated , a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based , the procedure in which laws are made and by whom .
Some constitutions , especially codified constitutions , also act as limiters of state power , by establishing lines which a state 's rulers can not cross , such as fundamental rights .
George Washington at Constitutional Convention of 1787 , signing of U.S. Constitution .
The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world , containing 448 articles , 12 schedules and 100 amendments , with 117,369 words in its English language version , while the United States Constitution is the shortest written constitution , at 7 articles and 27 amendments .
what is managerial engineering
Ron Diftler ( left ) , NASA Robonaut manager assisting in a Robonaut familiarization training session in the Space Environment Simulation Laboratory at NASA 's Johnson Space Center .
Engineering management is a specialized form of management that is concerned with the application of engineering principles to business practice .
Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving savvy of engineering and the organizational , administrative , and planning abilities of management in order to oversee complex enterprises from conception to completion .
Example areas of engineering are product development , manufacturing , construction , design engineering , industrial engineering , technology , production , or any other field that employs personnel who perform an engineering function .
Successful engineering managers typically require training and experience in business and engineering .
Technically inept managers tend to be deprived of support by their technical team , and non-commercial managers tend to lack commercial acumen to deliver in a market economy .
Largely , engineering managers manage engineers who are driven by non-entrepreneurial thinking , thus require the necessary people skills to coach , mentor and motivate technical professionals .
Engineering professionals joining manufacturing companies sometimes become engineering managers by default after a period of time .
They are required to learn how to manage once they are on the job , though this is usually an ineffective way to develop managerial abilities .
what is the meaning of reimbursement
In an insurance policy , the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses .
In general usage , the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses ( see below ) that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments .
Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of trivial claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of .
By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs , the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently , incurring much higher savings .
As a result , insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles .
Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder .
They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder .
The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount ( subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract ) .
Depending on the policy , the deductible may apply per covered incident , or per year .
For policies where incidences are not easy to delimit ( for example health insurance ) , the deductible is typically applied per year .
Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim .
For example , a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft , fire , natural calamities , evacuation etc .
There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an auto , home , boat/yacht or health insurance claim .
what is the use of a sales invoice ?
An invoice or bill is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer , indicating the products , quantities , and agreed prices for products or services the seller has provided the buyer .
An invoice indicates the sale transaction only .
Payment terms are independent of the invoice and are negotiated by the buyer and the seller .
Payment terms are usually included on the invoice .
The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice .
Buyer can also have a maximum number of days in which to pay for these goods and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date .
In the rental industry , an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed , so in addition to quantity , price and discount the invoicing amount is also based on duration .
Generally each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours , days , weeks , months , etc. , being billed .
From the point of view of a seller , an invoice is a sales invoice .
From the point of view of a buyer , an invoice is a purchase invoice .
The document indicates the buyer and seller , but the term invoice indicates money is owed or owing .
In English , the context of the term invoice is usually used to clarify its meaning , such as `` We sent them an invoice '' ( they owe us money ) or `` We received an invoice from them '' ( we owe them money ) .
what is the main primary bronchus
The right main bronchus ( or right primary bronchus , or right principal bronchus ) is a bronchus of the respiratory system .
It is wider , shorter , and more vertical in direction than the left .
It is about 2.5 cm long , and enters the right lung nearly opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra .
The azygos vein arches over it from behind ; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it .
About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the upper lobe of the right lung .
This is termed the eparterial branch of the bronchus , because it arises above the right pulmonary artery .
The bronchus now passes below the artery , and is known as the hyparterial branch ; it divides into two branches for the middle and lower lobes .
If a foreign body in the airway passes through the trachea , it will most likely enter the right main bronchus instead of the left , due to the straighter alignment of the right bronchus to the trachea .
what is squash the sport
Squash is a racquet sport played by two ( singles ) or four players ( doubles ) in a four-walled court with a small , hollow rubber ball .
The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racquet and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court .
The game was formerly called squash racquets , a reference to the `` squashable '' soft ball used in the game ( compared with the fatter ball used in its parent game racquets or rackets ) .
Squash is recognized by the IOC and supporters are lobbying for its incorporation in a future Olympic program .
In 2003 , Forbes rated squash as the number one healthiest sport to play .
what is fuel oil used for
Residual oil is oil found in low concentrations naturally or in exhausted oil fields .
Often mixed with water , it can not be recovered by conventional techniques .
However , it can be recovered using carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery ( CO2 EOR ) which involves injecting carbon dioxide into the well reducing viscosity and enhancing flow of the oil .
The technique is not new but has not been used extensively on residual oil zones , low-grade deposits of petroleum such as the 38 square miles in the Permian Basin of Texas leased by Elliott Roosevelt Jr .
The technique is limited by availability of carbon dioxide .
It does not result in sequestration of the carbon dioxide but the gas is recycled as much as possible .
United States reserves of residual oil are estimated to be 100 billion barrels .

where is henry viii buried
Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was king of England from 21 April 1509 until his death .
He was lord , and later king , of Ireland , as well as continuing the nominal claim by the English monarchs to the Kingdom of France .
Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .
Besides his six marriages , Henry VIII is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church .
Henry 's struggles with Rome led to the separation of the Church of England from papal authority , the Dissolution of the Monasteries , and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England .
Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings , even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church .
Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 .
In 1513 , the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor , Maximillian I , and invaded France in 1513 with a large , well-equipped army , but achieved little at a considerable financial cost .
Maximillian , for his part , used the English invasion to his own ends , and this prejudiced England 's ability to defeat the French .
This foray would prove the start of an obsession for Henry , who invaded again in 1544 .
This time , Henry 's forces captured the important city of Boulogne , but again the Holy Roman Emperor , Charles V , supported Henry only as long as he needed to and England , strained by the enormous cost of the war , ransomed the city back for peace .
His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' .
Besides ruling with absolute power , he also engaged himself as an author and composer .
His desire to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and the English Reformation .
Henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 .
He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king .

what is hosting a website
An example of rack mounted servers
A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web .
Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients , as well as providing Internet connectivity , typically in a data center .
Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other servers located in their data center , called colocation , also known as Housing in Latin America or France .
The scope of web hosting services varies greatly .
The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting , where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) or a Web interface .
The files are usually delivered to the Web `` as is '' or with minimal processing .
Many Internet service providers ( ISPs ) offer this service free to subscribers .
Individuals and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers .
Personal web site hosting is typically free , advertisement-sponsored , or inexpensive .
Business web site hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and type of the website .
Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages .
A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application development platforms ( e.g . PHP , Java , Ruby on Rails , ColdFusion , or ASP.NET ) .
These facilities allow customers to write or install scripts for applications like forums and content management .
Also , Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) is typically used for e-commerce .
The host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the Web server and installing scripts , as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail .
Some hosts specialize in certain software or services ( e.g . e-commerce ) , which are commonly used by larger companies that outsource network infrastructure .

But after declaring himself a presidential candidate , the Haitian-American-Irish hip-hop star also decided to come clean and confirm that he was really 40 . '' is a three-time Grammy Award -winning Haitian-American rapper , singer-songwriter , musician , record producer , and politician .
At age nine , Jean moved to the United States with his family and has spent much of his life in the country .
He first received fame as a member of the acclaimed New Jersey hip hop group the Fugees .
On August 5 , 2010 , Jean filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election , although the Electoral Commission subsequently ruled him ineligible to stand as he had not met the requirement to have been resident in Haiti for five years .
Wyclef Jean to appeal against Haiti election ruling – BBC News , Aug 22 , 2010 .
Haiti 's electoral commission said that Mr Jean was ineligible to stand as the Haitian constitution requires candidates to have lived in the country for five years prior to an election .
The 40-year-old singer lives in the US .

what is right to set off payments
In law , a set-off is a statutory defense to the whole or to a portion of a plaintiff 's claim .
It had no existence under the English common law , being created by 2 Geo . II c. 22 for the relief of insolvent debtors , although set-off was recognized in equity .
Such a defense could be pleaded only in respect of mutual debts of a definite character , and did not apply to cases in which damages were claimed , nor to equitable claims or demands .
By the rules of the Supreme Court ( O. XIX . r. 3 ) a defendant in an action may set off or set up any right or claim by way of counterclaim against the claims of a plaintiff , and such set-off or counterclaim has the same effect as a statement of claim in a cross-action .
The legal defense of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison , despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A .
The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court .
Upon judgment , both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing ( e.g . If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105 , the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A ) .
Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that , where a party defaults , the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished .
In certain jurisdictions ( including the UK ) , set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company .
This means that , for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company , mutual debts are set-off against each other , and then either the bankrupt 's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid , depending on which side owed the most .
This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu .
The alternative , where a creditor has to pay all its debts , but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get , poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies .
The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities .
The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed , because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the bank 's or its depositors ' money ) is thus replaced ( where the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken .

what is pci Interface
Conventional PCI ( PCI is an initialism formed from Peripheral Component Interconnect , part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI ) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer .
The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus , but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor .
Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus , and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space .
Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself , called a planar device in the PCI specification , or an expansion card that fits into a slot .
The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles , where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration .
It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types .
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express , but , most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots , which are sufficient for many uses .
The PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus ( including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ) , electrical characteristics , bus timing , and protocols .
The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group ( PCI-SIG ) .
Typical PCI cards used in PCs include : network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as USB or serial , TV tuner cards and disk controllers .
PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards , until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred interface for video cards became AGP , and then PCI Express .
PCI video cards remain available for use with old PCs without AGP or PCI Express slots .
Many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions .
what is in caffeine
Caffeine is a bitter , white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug .
Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds , leaves , and fruit of some plants , where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants , as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators .
It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush , as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut .
Other sources include yerba maté , guarana berries , guayusa , and the yaupon holly .
In humans , caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant , temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness .
It is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug , but unlike many other psychoactive substances , it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world .
Beverages containing caffeine , such as coffee , tea , soft drinks , and energy drinks , enjoy great popularity .
In North America , 90 % of adults consume caffeine daily .
Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) is that toxic doses ( over 10 grams ) are much higher than typically used doses ( less than 500 milligrams ) .
Ordinary consumption can have low health risks , even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases , including Parkinsons Disease , and certain types of cancer .
Caffeine can have both positive and negative effects on anxiety disorders .
Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine , especially during the evening hours , but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable .
Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal , but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less .
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women .
Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it , but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect , and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to dehydration .
With heavy use , tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and muscle twitching , but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine .
The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical and mental dependence remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature .

when was the first automobile
Vehicles in use per country from 2001 to 2007 .
It shows the significant growth in BRIC .
World map of passenger cars per 1000 people
An automobile , autocar , motor car or car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transporting passengers , which also carries its own engine or motor .
Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads , to have seating for one to eight people , to typically have four wheels , and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods .
The term motorcar has also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage .
These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems .
It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles , up from the 500 million of 1986 .
The numbers are increasing rapidly , especially in China and India .
When was John F. Kennedy born and when was he assassinated
John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy ( May 29 , 1917 – November 22 , 1963 ) , often referred to by his initials JFK , was the 35th President of the United States , serving from 1961 until his death in 1963 .
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts ' 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat .
Thereafter , he served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960 .
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election .
At 43 years of age , he is the youngest to have been elected to the office , the second-youngest President ( after Theodore Roosevelt ) , and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president .
A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president , and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize .
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African-American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War .
Therein , Kennedy increased the number of military advisers , special operation forces , and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia .
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government .
It involved certain forced relocation , village internment , and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents .
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22 , 1963 in Dallas , Texas .
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime , but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later , before a trial could take place .
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin .
However , the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations ( HSCA ) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
However , ABC News in their investigation , The Kennedy Assassination : Beyond Conspiracy , confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission ; having concluded Oswald acted alone .
Kennedy 's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970 .
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy 's private life has come to light .
Details of Kennedy 's health problems in which he struggled have become better known , especially since the 1990s .
Although initially kept secret from the general public , reports of Kennedy 's philandering have garnered much press .
Kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of U.S. presidents .

what is black swan about
Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller and horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , and Mila Kunis .
The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company .
The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan , for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit , as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan , which are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ) .
Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part , causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare .
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double , similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers .
Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's `` The Double `` as another inspiration for the film .
The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler , with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art .
He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000 , and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures .
Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming , and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation .
The film premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1 , 2010 .
It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3 , 2010 and opened nationwide on December 17 .
Black Swan received critical praise upon its release , particularly for Portman 's performance and Aronofsky 's direction , and was a significant box office success , grossing $ 329 million worldwide .
The film received five Academy Award nominations and Portman won the Best Actress award for the film , as well as many other Best Actress awards in several guilds and festivals , while Aronofsky was nominated for Best Director .
In addition , the film itself received a nomination for Best Picture .
what is the internal pressure of a bomb calorimeter
The world’s first ice-calorimeter , used in the winter of 1782-83 , by Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace , to determine the heat involved in various chemical changes ; calculations which were based on Joseph Black ’s prior discovery of latent heat .
These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry .
A calorimeter ( from Latin calor , meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry , or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity .
Differential scanning calorimeters , isothermal microcalorimeters , titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types .
A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber .
To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B , the substances are added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures ( before the reaction started and after it has finished ) are noted .
Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction .
Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives its enthalpy change of reaction .
This method is used primarily in academic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry .
It does not account for the heat loss through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer and container itself .
In addition , the object placed inside the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the calorimeter and into the liquid , and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the liquid is equal to the heat given off by the metals .
where are flip flops made at
A pair of green flip-flops
Flip-flops ( also called zōri , thongs , jandals , or a variety of other names throughout the world ) are a type of open-toed sandal typically worn in casual situations , such as outside or at the beach .
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap that passes between the first and second toes and around either side of the foot .
They may also be held to the foot with a single strap over the front of the foot rather than a thong .
The name `` flip-flop '' originated because of the sound that is made by slapping between the sole of the foot and the floor when walking .
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world , originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 4,000 B.C .
The modern flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri , which became popular after World War II when soldiers returning to the United States brought them back .
They became popular in casual settings during the 1960s , 1990s , and 2000s , and some varieties have even found their way into more formal attire , despite criticism .
The use of flip-flops can result in many pains and injuries , including ankle sprains and broken bones .
Some individuals who walk for long periods report pain in the feet , ankles , and lower legs .
The lack of support provided by flip-flops often results in over-pronation injuries , caused by the foot slipping inwards further than normal .
This can lead to flat feet and tendonitis .
Other injuries that may result are due to the footwear 's open-toed nature , such as stubbed toes , cuts , and bruises .
Doctors recommend purchasing pricier sandals with thick-cushioned soles , as well as those that have a strap that is not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle .
what is general average sacrifice
The owners of Hanjin Osaka , seen here transiting the Panama Canal in 2008 , declared general average following an explosion in the ship 's engine room on .
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties in a sea venture proportionally share any losses resulting from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency .
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea , crew members often have precious little time in which to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning .
Thus , to avoid quarrelling that could waste valuable time , there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion , based upon a share or percentage , to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril .
While general average traces its origins in ancient maritime law , still it remains part of the admiralty law of most countries .
The first codification of general average was the York Antwerp Rules of 1890 .
American companies accepted it in 1949 .
General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by Mr. Justice Grier in Barnard v. Adams:
`` 1st .
A common danger : a danger in which vessel , cargo and crew all participate ; a danger imminent and apparently 'inevitable , ' except by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the whole to save the remainder . ''
`` 2nd . There must be a voluntary jettison , jactus , or casting away , of some portion of the joint concern for the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril , periculi imminentis evitandi causa , or , in other words , a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole . ''
`` 3rd .
This attempt to avoid the imminent common peril must be successful '' .
when was mumpsvax administered in 1960
Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus .
A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations , including the timing of all doses , which may be either recommended or compulsory , depending on the country of residence .
A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to produce active immunity to a disease , in order to prevent or reduce the effects of infection by any natural or `` wild '' pathogen .
Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness , either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time .
For example , tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years .
Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions .
Over the past two decades , the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed .
Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas ( countries , subnational areas , or at-risk populations ) where a disease is common .
For instance , yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana , is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease .
In developing countries , vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access , the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage .
Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child 's life and uses vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $ 25 .
This difference is due to the lower cost of health care , the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations , and that more expensive vaccines , often for less common diseases , are not utilized .
In 1900 , the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children .
By the early 1950s , children routinely received four vaccines , for protection against ( diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus , polio , and smallpox ) , and as many as five shots by two years of age .
Since the mid-1980s , many vaccines have been added to the schedule .
, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseases .
By two years of age , U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections , and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctor .
The use of combination vaccine products means that , , the United Kingdom 's immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two , rather than 25 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection .
when is carnival in trinidad for 2011
Two revellers dance in the streets .
The form of dancing is called `` wining '' ( winding ) pronounced wine-ing
A Music Truck entertains the crowd on the streets .
Trucks are an integral part of the street parade , featuring live performances or deejays
The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is an annual event held on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday , and is well known for participant 's colorful costumes and exuberant celebrations .
Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago is the most significant event on the islands ' cultural and tourism calendar , with numerous cultural events running in the lead up to the street parade on Carnival Monday and Tuesday .
It is said that if the islanders are not celebrating it , then they are preparing for it , while reminiscing about the past year 's festival .
The heart of the musical celebration has been calypso ; recently soca has replaced calypso as the most celebrated type of music .
Costumes , stickfighting and limbo competitions are also important components of the festival .
Carnival as it is celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago is also celebrated in cities worldwide .
These including Toronto 's Caribana , Miami 's Miami Carnival , Houston Carifest , London 's Notting Hill Carnival as well as New York City 's Labor Day Carnival to name a few .
Carnival was created when West African slaves mimicked their French owners who where known for their lavish costumes balls .
Forbidden to partake in these festivities and confined to their quarters , slaves combined elements from their own cultures to their master 's fete .
Hence the creation of characters such as Jab Jab or Jab Molassie ( Devils ) , Midnight Robbers , Imps , Lagahroo , Soucouyant , La Diablesse and Demons .
With the abolition of slavery in 1838 , freed Africans took their version of Carnival to the streets through expression of drums , riddim sections like tamboo bamboo and as each new immigrant population entered Trinidad , Carnival evolved into what we know today .

who was the 16 president of the united states
The White House , the president 's official residence and center of the administration
Under the United States Constitution , the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
As chief of the executive branch and head of the federal government as a whole , the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition .
The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College ( or by the House of Representatives should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person ) .
Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951 , no person may be elected President more than twice , and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once .
Upon the death , resignation , or removal from office of an incumbent President , the Vice President assumes the office .
The President must be at least 35 years of age and a `` natural born '' citizen of the United States .
This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution , which took effect on March 4 , 1789 .
For American leaders before this ratification , see President of the Continental Congress .
The list does not include any Acting Presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution .
There have been 43 people sworn into office , and 44 presidencies , as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president .
Of the individuals elected as president , four died in office of natural causes ( William Henry Harrison , Zachary Taylor , Warren G. Harding , and Franklin D. Roosevelt ) , four were assassinated ( Abraham Lincoln , James A. Garfield , William McKinley , and John F. Kennedy ) and one resigned ( Richard Nixon ) .
George Washington , the first president , was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College .
William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841 , and Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years , but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945 .
He is the only president to serve more than two terms , and a constitutional amendment , affecting presidents after Harry Truman , was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president .
Andrew Jackson , the seventh president , was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed .
Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920 .
History records four presidents – John Q Adams , Rutherford B. Hayes , Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – who lost the popular vote but assumed office .
John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith , and the current president , Barack Obama , is the first president of African descent .

who is the world 's oldest person
This is a list of tables of the verified oldest people in the world in ordinal rank , such as oldest person or oldest man .
In these tables , a supercentenarian is considered 'verified ' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research , such as the Gerontology Research Group ( GRG ) or Guinness World Records .
The longest unambiguously documented human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France ( 1875–1997 ) , who died at age 122 years , 164 days .
She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13 .
This led to news media attention in 1985 , after Calment turned 110 .
Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment 's age , beyond any reasonable question , in the records of her native city , Arles , France .
More evidence of Calment 's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian ; her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world 's oldest people .
The longest undisputed lifespan for male supercentenarians is that of Jiroemon Kimura , who currently lives in Japan and is age as of .
Since the death of 115-year old Dina Manfredini of the United States , on 17 December 2012 , Kimura , born 19 April 1897 , is the oldest living person in the world whose age can be documented .
He has also been the oldest living man since the death of 114-year old Walter Breuning on 14 April 2011 .
Since the death of 115-year old Koto Okubo of Japan on 12 January 2013 , the oldest living woman has been -year-old Misao Okawa , also from Japan , born on 5 March 1898 .

The People 's Court is the first court show to use binding arbitration , introducing the format into the genre in 1981 .
The system has been duplicated by most of the show 's successors in the judicial genre .
Moreover , The People 's Court is the first popular , long-running reality in the judicial genre .
It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre ; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings , except for one : Parole ( 1959 ) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings .
Prior to The People 's Court , the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors , and recreated or fictional cases ( as did radio before that ) .
Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness .
The People 's Court has had two contrasting lives .
The show 's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner .
His tenure lasted from the show 's debut on September 14 , 1981 , until May 21 , 1993 , when the show was cancelled due to low ratings .
This left the show with a total of 2,484 1⁄2-hour episodes and 12 seasons .
The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life .
After being cancelled , reruns aired until September 9 , 1994 .
On September 8 , 1997 , after being out of production for four years , The People 's Court was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program .
Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter , which he maintained for 2 seasons from the 1997–98 season through the 1998–99 season ( the present life 's 2nd season and overall show 's 14th ) .
By the 1999–00 season , husband of Judith Sheindlin ( who presides over Judge Judy ) and former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin succeeded Koch .
Sheindlin lasted one and a half seasons as he was replaced towards the end of the 2000–01 season ( present life 's 4th season and overall show 's 17th ) .
Beginning in spring 2001 , Florida judge Marilyn Milian took over The People 's Court and has presided over the show ever since .
Once Milian completes the 2012–13 season , she will have served as longest arbiter over the series with 12 and a half seasons .
As of the present , however , her years on the program tie Wapner at 12 seasons .
In the 2009-10 television season , The People 's Courts 2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons .
While the show taped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life , it now tapes in Stamford , Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season .
On September 3 , 2012 , The People 's Court 's 2nd/present life entered its 16th season ( 28th overall season ) .
With 28 total seasons , The People 's Court ranks as the 2nd longest-running courtroom program behind the ongoing Divorce Court at 33 seasons ( from its 3 combined lives ) .

It became the 45th state admitted to the Union on January 4 , 1896 .
Utah is the 13th-largest , the 34th-most populous , and the 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States .
Approximately 80 % of Utah 's 2,817,222 people live along the Wasatch Front , centering on Salt Lake City , leaving vast expanses of the state nearly uninhabited and making the population the sixth most urbanized in the U.S. Utah is bordered by Colorado on the east , Wyoming on the northeast , Idaho on the north , Arizona on the south , and Nevada on the west .
It also touches a corner of New Mexico on the southeast .
Utah is the most religiously homogeneous state in the Union .
Approximately 63 % of Utahns are reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS ( Mormons ) , which greatly influences Utah culture and daily life .
The world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) is located in Utah 's state capital .
The state is a center of transportation , education , information technology and research , government services , mining , and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau 's population estimates , Utah is the fifth fastest-growing state in the United States as of 2012 .
St. George , was the fastest–growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005 .
A 2012 Gallup national survey found Utah overall to be the `` best state to live in '' based on 13 forward-looking measurements including various economic , lifestyle , and health-related outlook metrics .
what is the location of coldwater ms
Coldwater is a small town in Tate County , Mississippi .
It is in the Memphis Metropolitan Area .
The population was 1,674 at the 2000 census .
what is the function of the hard palate
The hard palate is a thin horizontal bony plate of the skull , located in the roof of the mouth .
It spans the arch formed by the upper teeth .
It is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla and horizontal plate of palatine bone .
It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth .
Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx .
This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate .
what is the jewish bible called
Complete set of scrolls , constituting the entire Tanakh .
The Tanakh ( , or ; also Tenakh , Tenak , Tanach ) is a name used in Judaism for the canon of the Hebrew Bible .
The Tanakh is also known as the Masoretic Text or the Miqra .
The name is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the Masoretic Text 's three traditional subdivisions : The Torah ( `` Teaching '' , also known as the Five Books of Moses ) , Nevi'im ( `` Prophets '' ) and Ketuvim ( `` Writings '' ) —hence TaNaKh .
The name `` Miqra '' ( מקרא ) , meaning `` that which is read '' , is an alternative Hebrew term for the Tanakh .
The books of the Tanakh were relayed with an accompanying oral tradition passed on by each generation , called the Oral Torah .
what is the drinking and driving act
Sobriety checkpoint in Germany
Driving under the influence ( DUI ) , driving while intoxicated ( DWI ) , drunken driving , drunk driving , drink driving , operating under the influence , drinking and driving , or impaired driving is the crime of driving a motor vehicle with blood levels of alcohol in excess of a legal limit ( `` Blood Alcohol Content '' , or `` BAC '' ) .
Similar regulations cover driving or operating certain types of machinery while affected by drinking alcohol or taking other drugs , including , but not limited to prescription drugs .
This is a criminal offense in most nations .
Convictions do not necessarily involve actual driving of the vehicle .
In most jurisdictions a measurement such as a blood alcohol content ( BAC ) in excess of a specific threshold level , such as 0.05 % or 0.08 % defines the offense , with no need to prove impairment or being under the influence of alcohol .
In some jurisdictions , there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher level e.g . 0.12 % .
In most countries , anyone who is convicted of injuring or killing someone while under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be heavily fined , as in France , in addition to being given a lengthy prison sentence .
Some jobs have their own rules and BAC limits , for example commercial pilot , and the Federal Railroad Administration in the United States has a 0.04 % limit for train crew .
Some jurisdictions have multiple levels of BAC ; for example , the state of California has a 0.08 % BAC limit , which is lowered to 0.04 % if the operator holds a commercial driver 's license .
The California BAC limit is 0.01 % for those younger than 21 years of age and those on probation for a previous DUI conviction .
Some large corporations have their own rules ; Union Pacific Railroad has their own BAC limit of 0.02 % that , if violated during a random test or a for-cause test — for example , after a traffic accident — can result in termination of employment with no chance of future re-hire .
Many states in the U.S. and provinces in Canada have adopted truth in sentencing laws that enforce strict guidelines on sentencing , differing from previous practice where prison time was reduced or suspended after sentencing had been issued .
Some jurisdictions have judicial guidelines requiring a mandatory minimum sentence .
Penalties for DUI charges range from expensive fees to forfetiruree of your license plates and in some serious circumstances , your vehicle .
A drunk driving simulator in Montréal , Canada
The specific criminal offense may be called , depending on the jurisdiction , driving under the influence [ of alcohol or other drugs ] ( DUI ) , driving under intense influence ( DUII ) , driving while intoxicated ( DWI ) , operating under the influence ( OUI ) operating while intoxicated ( OWI ) , operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated ( OMVI ) , driving under the combined influence of alcohol and/or other drugs , driving under the influence per se or drunk in charge [ of a vehicle ] .
Many such laws apply also to motorcycling , boating , piloting aircraft , use of motile farm equipment such as tractors and combines , riding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle , or bicycling , possibly with different BAC level than driving .
In some jurisdictions there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used , such as BWI ( bicycling while intoxicated ) , which may carry a lighter sentence .
In the United States , local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996 , compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983 .
In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in prison or jail , down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986 .
what was the first police department in the United states ?
Officers from US Customs and Border Protection boarding a ship
Law enforcement in the United States is one of three major components of the criminal justice system of the United States , along with courts and corrections .
Although there exists an inherent interrelatedness between the different groups that make up the criminal justice system based on their crime deterrence purpose , each component operates independently from one another .
However , the judiciary is vested with the power to make legal determinations regarding the conduct of the other two components .
Apart from maintaining order and service functions , the purpose of policing is the investigation of suspected criminal activity and the referral of the results of investigations and of suspected criminals to the courts .
Law enforcement , to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies , is also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and of preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress ; the service and enforcement of warrants , writs and other orders of the courts .
Law enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to public safety ; the protection of certain public facilities and infrastructure ; the maintenance of public order ; the protection of public officials ; and the operation of some correctional facilities ( usually at the local level ) .

WHERE WAS JOHN WAYNE BORN
Marion Mitchell Morrison ( born Marion Robert Morrison ; May 26 , 1907 – June 11 , 1979 ) , better known by his stage name John Wayne , was an American film actor , director and producer .
An Academy Award -winner , Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades , and was named the all-time top money-making star .
An enduring American icon , he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his demeanor , including his distinctive calm voice , walk , and height .
Wayne was born in Winterset , Iowa but his family relocated to the greater Los Angeles area when he was four years old .
He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to USC as a result of a bodysurfing accident .
Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation , he mostly appeared in small bit parts .
His first leading role came in the widescreen epic The Big Trail ( 1930 ) , which led to leading roles in numerous films throughout the 1930s , many of them in the western genre .
His career rose to further heights in 1939 , with John Ford 's Stagecoach making him an instant superstar .
Wayne would go on to star in 142 pictures , primarily typecast in Western films .
Among his best known later films are The Quiet Man ( 1952 ) , which follows him as an Irish-American boxer and his love affair with a fiery spinster played by Maureen O'Hara ; The Searchers ( 1956 ) , in which he plays a Civil War veteran who seeks out his abducted niece ; Rio Bravo ( 1959 ) , playing a Sheriff with Dean Martin ; True Grit ( 1969 ) , playing a humorous U.S . Marshal who sets out to avenge a man 's death in the role that won Wayne an Academy Award ; and The Shootist ( 1976 ) , his final screen performance in which he plays an aging gunslinger battling cancer .
Wayne moved to Orange County , California in the 1960s , and was a prominent Republican in Hollywood , supporting anti-communist positions .
He died of stomach cancer in 1979 .
In June 1999 , the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of All Time .
what was galileo galilei 's personality
Galileo Galilei ( ; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642 ) , was an Italian physicist , mathematician , astronomer , and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution .
His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism .
Galileo has been called the `` father of modern observational astronomy `` , the `` father of modern physics `` , the `` father of science '' , and `` the Father of Modern Science '' .
His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus , the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter ( named the Galilean moons in his honour ) , and the observation and analysis of sunspots .
Galileo also worked in applied science and technology , inventing an improved military compass and other instruments .
Galileo 's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime , when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system .
He met with opposition from astronomers , who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax .
The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615 , and they concluded that it could be supported as only a possibility , not an established fact .
Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits , who had both supported Galileo up until this point .
He was tried by the Inquisition , found `` vehemently suspect of heresy '' , forced to recant , and spent the rest of his life under house arrest .
It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works , Two New Sciences , in which he summarised the work he had done some forty years earlier , on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials .
what is the organic layer in an amoled screen
55 '' LG OLED TV showcased at CES 2012
Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec
Demonstration of a flexible OLED device
An OLED ( organic light-emitting diode ) is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current .
This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes .
Generally , at least one of these electrodes is transparent .
OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens , computer monitors , portable systems such as mobile phones , handheld games consoles and PDAs .
A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications .
There are two main families of OLEDs : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers .
Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC , which has a slightly different mode of operation .
OLED displays can use either passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix addressing schemes .
Active-matrix OLEDs ( AMOLED ) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off , but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes .
An OLED display works without a backlight .
Thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) .
In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD , whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight .
what is eggnog made of
A carton and a glass of eggnog from Montreal , Canada , showing its French facade ( English reverse ) and the French term lait de poule ( literally , `` hen 's milk '' )
Eggnog , or egg nog , is a sweetened dairy -based beverage traditionally made with milk and/or cream , sugar , and whipped eggs ( which gives it a frothy texture ) .
Brandy , rum , whisky , bourbon , vodka , or a combination of liquors are often added .
The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg .
It was also known as the egg milk punch .
Eggnog is a popular drink throughout the United States and Canada , and is usually associated with Christmas .
Eggnog may be added as a flavoring to food or drinks such as coffee and tea .
Eggnog as a custard can also be used as an ice cream base .
what is in a pasty
A pasty ( , ) , ( sometimes known in Britain as a Cornish pasty , and in the United States as a pastie or British pasty ) is a baked pastry , a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall , the westernmost county in England .
It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables , without meat in vegetarian versions , on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling , crimping the edge to form a seal .
After baking , the result is a raised semicircular comestible .
The traditional Cornish pasty , which has Protected Geographical Indication ( PGI ) status in Europe , is filled with beef , sliced or diced potato , swede ( also known as a yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip ) and onion , seasoned with salt and pepper , and is baked .
Today , the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall , it is regarded as the national dish , and it accounts for 6 % of the Cornish food economy .
Pasties with many different fillings are made ; some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties .
The origins of the pasty are unclear , though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction .
The pasty is now popular world-wide due to the spread of Cornish miners , and variations can be found in Australia , the United States , Mexico and elsewhere .
what is sympathetic stimulation
The ( ortho- ) sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) is one of three major parts of the autonomic nervous system : the others being the enteric and parasympathetic systems .
Its general action is to mobilize the body 's nervous system fight-or-flight response .
It is , however , constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis .
WHAT IS THE SPEED CLASS FOR CAMERA
Secure Digital or ( SD ) is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices , such as mobile phones , digital cameras , GPS navigation devices , and tablet computers .
The Secure Digital standard is maintained by the SD Card Association ( SDA ) .
SD technologies have been implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of product categories and more than 8,000 models .
The Secure Digital format includes four card families available in three different form factors .
The four families are the original Standard-Capacity ( SDSC ) , the High-Capacity ( SDHC ) , the eXtended-Capacity ( SDXC ) , and the SDIO , which combines input/output functions with data storage .
The three form factors are the original size , the `` mini '' size , and the `` micro '' size ( see illustration ) .
There are many combinations of form factors and device families .
Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to hold a larger card .
Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards , but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card:
A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle .
A newer card may use a file system the host device can not navigate .
Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides .
The organization of the card was changed starting with the SDHC family .
Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so .
The SDA uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility .

The first episode of the series aired on February 8 , 2011 .
what is the purpose of vitamin d
Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate .
In humans , the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 .
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements .
The body can also synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) when sun exposure is adequate ( hence its nickname , the `` sunshine vitamin '' ) .
Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin , it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense , as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight .
( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet . )
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from their diet .
However , as with other compounds commonly called vitamins , vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease , namely , rickets , the childhood form of osteomalacia .
Additionally , like other compounds called vitamins , in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods , such as milk , to avoid disease due to deficiency .
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet , and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations .
The evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but , because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight , no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine , USA , for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements .
Accordingly , the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet , although that will rarely occur in practice .
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol , which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ) , 25-hydroxycholecalciferol , or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status .
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol , the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood , regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone .
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes , such as the proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation .
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets , the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent .
The best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women .
what is an element on a periodic table
Standard form of the periodic table .
The colors represent different categories of elements explained below .
The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements , organized on the basis of their atomic numbers , electron configurations , and recurring chemical properties .
Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ) .
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main body of elements , positioned above a smaller double row of elements .
The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left , the p-block to the right , the d-block in the middle , and the f-block below that .
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s- , d- , and p-blocks are called groups , with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases .
Since , by definition , a periodic table incorporates recurring trends , any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new , yet to be discovered or synthesized , elements .
As a result , a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior , and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences .
Although precursors exist , Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication , in 1869 , of the first widely recognized periodic table .
He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements .
Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table .
Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered .
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior .
All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized .
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally , although some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories .
The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories .
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued , with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate .
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories .
what is minimum wage of 2010
Minimum wage by U.S. state and U.S. territory ( American Samoa , Guam , Puerto Rico , Virgin Islands ) , as of Jan. 1 , 2013 .
In the United States , workers are generally entitled to be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage .
The federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage level of $ 7.25 per hour , while some states and municipalities have set minimum wage levels higher than the federal level , with the highest state minimum wage being $ 9.19 per hour in Washington as of 2013 .
Among those paid by the hour in 2012 , 1.6 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage .
About 2.0 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum .
Together , these 3.6 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 4.7 percent of all hourly-paid workers .
what is bourbon made of
A selection of Bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys offered at a liquor store in Decatur , Georgia
Evan Williams bourbon whiskey
Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey – a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn .
The name of the spirit derives from its historical association with an area known as Old Bourbon , around what is now Bourbon County , Kentucky ( which , in turn , was named after the French House of Bourbon royal family ) .
It has been produced since the 18th century .
While it may be made anywhere in the United States , it is strongly associated with the American South in general , and Kentucky in particular .
WHERE IS THE REAL MONA LISA LOCATED ?
The Mona Lisa ( La Gioconda or La Joconde ) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci , which has been acclaimed as `` the best known , the most visited , the most written about , the most sung about , the most parodied work of art in the world . ''
The painting , thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini , the wife of Francesco del Giocondo , is in oil on a poplar panel , and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506 .
It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic , on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris since 1797 .
The ambiguity of the subject 's expression , which is frequently described as enigmatic , the monumentality of the composition , the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work .
where is robert palmer now
Robert Allen Palmer ( 19 January 1949 – 26 September 2003 ) , was an English singer-songwriter and musician .
He was known for his distinctive voice and the eclectic mix of musical styles on his albums , combining soul , jazz , rock , pop , reggae and blues .
He found success both in his solo career and in the musical act The Power Station , and had Top 10 songs in both the UK and the US .
His iconic music videos by Terence Donovan for the hits `` Addicted to Love `` and `` Simply Irresistible `` featured identically dressed dancing women with pale faces , dark eye makeup and bright red lipstick , which resembled the women in the art of Patrick Nagel , an artist popular in the 1980s .
Sharp-suited , his involvement in the music industry commenced in the 1960s , covered five decades and included a spell with Vinegar Joe .
Palmer received a number of awards throughout his career , including two Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance , an MTV Video Music Award , and was twice nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male .

Prise de la Bastille by Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Houel
Bastille Day is the name given in English-speaking countries to the French National Day , which is celebrated on the 14th of July each year .
In France , it is formally called La Fête Nationale ( ; The National Celebration ) and commonly Le quatorze juillet ( ; the fourteenth of July ) .
It commemorates the 1790 Fête de la Fédération , held on the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 ; the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille fortress-prison was seen as a symbol of the uprising of the modern nation , and of the reconciliation of all the French inside the constitutional monarchy which preceded the First Republic , during the French Revolution .
Festivities and official ceremonies are held all over France .
The oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe is held on the morning of 14 July , on the Champs-Élysées avenue in Paris in front of the President of the Republic , French officials and foreign guests .

where was the first march madness game played
The NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States , currently featuring 68 college basketball teams , to determine the national championship of the major college basketball teams .
The tournament , organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , was created during 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches , and was the idea of Ohio State University coach Harold Olsen .
Played mostly during March , it is known informally as March Madness or the Big Dance , and has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States .
The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration during 1984 .
The tournament teams include champions from 31 Division I conferences ( which receive automatic bids ) , and 37 teams which are awarded at-large berths .
These `` at-large '' teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee , as detailed below .
The 64 teams are divided into four regions and organized into a single elimination `` bracket '' , which predetermines , when a team wins a game , which team it will face next .
Each team is `` seeded '' , or ranked , within its region .
After an initial four games between eight lower-ranked teams , the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends , at pre-selected neutral sites around the United States .
Lower-ranked teams are placed in the bracket against higher ranked teams .
Each weekend eliminates three-fourths of the teams , from a round of 64 , to a `` Sweet Sixteen '' , and for the last weekend of the Tournament a Final Four ; the Final Four is usually played during the first weekend of April .
These four teams , one from each region , then compete in one location for the national championship .
The tournament has been at least partially televised since 1969 .
Presently , the games are reported by CBS , TBS , TNT , and truTV by the trade-name NCAA March Madness .
Since 2011 , all games are available for viewing nationwide .
As television coverage has grown , so too has the tournament 's popularity .
Presently , millions of Americans `` fill out a bracket '' , predicting winners of all 67 games .
With 11 national titles , UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championships ; John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles .
The University of Kentucky is second , with 8 national titles , while Indiana University and the University of North Carolina are tied for third with 5 national titles .
Duke University ranks fifth with 4 national titles .
what is neo lubrication
A sample of synthetic motor oil
Synthetic oil is a lubricant consisting of chemical compounds that are artificially made ( synthesized ) .
Synthetic lubricants can be manufactured using chemically modified petroleum components rather than whole crude oil , but can also be synthesized from other raw materials .
Synthetic oil is used as a substitute for lubricant refined from petroleum when operating in extremes of temperature , because , in general , it provides superior mechanical and chemical properties than those found in traditional mineral oils .
Aircraft jet engines , for example , require the use of synthetic oils , whereas aircraft piston engines do not .

when was jesus baptized
Francesco Albani 's 17th century Baptism of Christ is a typical depiction with the sky opening and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove .
The baptism of Jesus marks the beginning of his public ministry .
This event is recorded in the canonical gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke .
John 's gospel does not describe Jesus ' baptism , but John the Baptist does testify of the other things in .
In the New Testament , John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ( ) , and declared himself a forerunner of he that would baptize `` with the Holy Ghost and with fire '' ( ) .
In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus .
Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John .
The baptismal scene includes the heavens opening , a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit , and a voice from heaven saying , `` This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . ''
Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned .
Along with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him , and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus .
The baptism is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus , the others being the Transfiguration , Crucifixion , Resurrection , and Ascension .
Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian rite of baptism ( see also ) .
In Eastern Christianity , Jesus ' baptism is commemorated on 6 January , the feast of Epiphany .
In the Roman Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion , the Lutheran Churches and some other Western denominations , it is recalled on a day within the following week , the feast of the baptism of the Lord .
In Roman Catholicism , the baptism of Jesus is one of the Luminous Mysteries sometimes added to the Rosary .
It is a Trinitarian feast in the Eastern Orthodox Churches .
what is vitamin b12 used for
Methylcobalamin ( shown ) is a form of vitamin B12 .
Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12 , occurring as dark red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water .
Vitamin B12 , vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12 , also called cobalamin , is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system , and for the formation of blood .
It is one of the eight B vitamins .
It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body , especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation , but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production .
Neither fungi , plants , nor animals are capable of producing vitamin B12 .
Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis , although many foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis .
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis .
Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ) , all of which have vitamin activity .
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt .
Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria ( which usually produce hydroxocobalamin ) , but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body .
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin , cyanocobalamin , does not occur in nature , but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements , and as a food additive , because of its stability and lower production cost .
In the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin , leaving behind the cyanide , albeit in minimal concentration .
More recently , hydroxocobalamin , methylcobalamin , and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements .
The extra utility of these is currently debated .
Vitamin B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia , which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed .
Intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of B12 , so a lack of intrinsic factor , as seen in pernicious anemia , causes a vitamin B12 deficiency .
Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated .

who was the killer in scream 3
Scream 3 is a 2000 American slasher film created by Kevin Williamson , directed by Wes Craven and written by Ehren Kruger , starring Neve Campbell , Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette .
It was released on February 4 , 2000 as the third installment in the Scream film series .
The events of the story are set three years after those of Scream 2 and follows Sidney Prescott ( Campbell ) who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films but is drawn to Hollywood after a new Ghostface begins killing the cast of the film within a film `` Stab 3 '' .
Scream 3 combines the violence of the slasher genre with comedy and `` whodunit `` mystery while satirizing the cliché of film trilogies .
Unlike the previous Scream films , there was an increased emphasis on comedic elements and the violence and horror was reduced in response to increased public scrutiny about violence in media following the Columbine High School massacre .
The film was the concluding chapter of the Scream series until it was revived with a sequel , Scream 4 , in 2011 .
Williamson provided a five-page outline for two sequels to Scream when auctioning his original script , hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise .
Williamson 's commitments to other projects meant he was unable to develop a complete script for Scream 3 and writing duties were undertaken by Ehren Kruger who discarded much of Williamson 's notes .
Craven and Marco Beltrami returned to direct and score the film respectively as they had with the previous two series entries .
Production was troubled with script rewrites , with pages sometimes only ready on the day of filming , and scheduling difficulties with the main cast .
Scream 3 performed both financially and critically worse than its preceding films , earning over $ 161 million and with many critics claiming that the film had become what Scream originally `` spoofed `` .
Despite negative criticism the film did receive praise with reviewers calling it the perfect end to the Scream trilogy .
As of 2012 , the film is currently the number 3 highest-grossing slasher-film in North America , following Scream at number 1 and Scream 2 at number 2 .
The film 's soundtrack was well-received , spending fourteen weeks on the Billboard 200 and reaching a high of # 32 .

what is colonial americans day in usa
The colonial history of the United States covers the history of European settlements from the start of colonization of America until their incorporation into the United States .
In the late 16th century , England , France , Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America .
Small early attempts—such as the English Lost Colony of Roanoke —often disappeared ; everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high .
Nevertheless successful colonies were established .
European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups .
No aristocrats settled permanently , but a number of adventurers , soldiers , farmers , and tradesmen arrived .
Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of New Netherland , the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden , the English Quakers of Pennsylvania , the English Puritans of New England , the English settlers of Jamestown , and the `` worthy poor '' of Georgia , came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social , religious , political and economic styles .
Occasionally one colony took control of another ( during wars between their European parents ) .
Only in Nova Scotia ( now part of Canada ) did the conquerors expel the previous colonists .
Instead they all lived side by side in peace .
There were no major civil wars among the 13 colonies , and the two chief armed rebellions ( in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689–91 ) were short-lived failures .
Wars between the French and the British—the French and Indian Wars and Father Rale 's War —were recurrent , and involved French-support for Wabanaki Confederacy attacks on the frontiers .
By 1760 France was defeated and the British seized its colonies .
The four distinct regions were : New England , the Middle Colonies , the Chesapeake Bay Colonies ( Upper South ) and the Lower South .
Some historians add a fifth region , the Frontier , which was never separately organized .
By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650 , the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United States had been decimated by new diseases , introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors .

what is the significance of Greenwich England
A prime meridian is a meridian , i.e . a line of longitude , at which longitude is defined to be 0° .
A prime meridian and its opposite in a 360°-system , the 180th meridian ( at 180° longitude ) , form a great circle .
This great circle divides the sphere , e.g . the Earth , into two hemispheres .
If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian , then they can be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere .
Gerardus Mercator in his Atlas Cosmographicae ( 1595 ) uses a prime meridian somewhere close to 25°W , passing just to the west of Santa Maria Island in the Atlantic .
His 180th meridian runs along the Strait of Anián ( Bering Strait )
A prime meridian is ultimately arbitrary , unlike an equator , which is determined by the axis of rotation—and various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions and throughout history .

where is mint mark on liberty standing half
The Walking Liberty half dollar was a silver 50-cent piece or half dollar coin issued by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1947 ; it was designed by Adolph A. Weinman .
In 1915 , the new Mint Director , Robert W. Woolley , came to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years .
He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes , quarters and half dollars , all bearing similar designs by long-time Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber , and first struck in 1892 .
Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition , as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar .
Weinman 's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect , and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo , whose department included the Mint , considered having Barber create his own design .
Mint officials were successful in getting Weinman 's design into production , although it never struck very well , which may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948 .
Nevertheless , art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins .
Since 1986 , a modification of Weinman 's obverse design has been used for the American Silver Eagle .

who was the first one to invent medicine
This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals from ancient times to the present .
The ancient Egyptians had a system of medicine that was very advanced for its time and influenced later medical traditions .
The Egyptians and Babylonians both introduced the concepts of diagnosis , prognosis , and medical examination .
The Greeks went even further , and advanced as well medical ethics .
The Hippocratic Oath , still taken by doctors today , was written in Greece in the 5th century BCE .
In the medieval era , surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius 's The Practice of Surgery .
Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy .
During the Renaissance , understanding of anatomy improved , and the microscope was invented .
The germ theory of disease in the 19th century led to cures for many infectious diseases .
Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery .
Public health measures were developed especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures .
Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century , often connected with major hospitals .
The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments , such as antibiotics .
These advancements , along with developments in chemistry , genetics , and lab technology ( such as the x-ray ) led to modern medicine .
Medicine was heavily professionalized in the 20th century , and new careers opened to women as nurses ( from the 1870s ) and as physicians ( especially after 1970 ) .
The 21st century is characterized by very advanced research involving numerous fields of science .
The Hippocratic Corpus , is a collection of early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates and his teachings .
what is the half life of potassium 40
Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K ( from Neo-Latin kalium ) and atomic number 19 .
Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive with water , generating sufficient heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame .
Because potassium and sodium are chemically very similar , their salts were not at first differentiated .
The existence of multiple elements in their salts was suspected from 1702 , and this was proven in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis .
Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts .
As such , it is found dissolved in seawater ( which is 0.04 % potassium by weight ) , and is part of many minerals .
Most industrial chemical applications of potassium employ the relatively high solubility in water of potassium compounds , such as potassium soaps .
Potassium metal has only a few special applications , being replaced in most chemical reactions with sodium metal .
Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells .
Potassium ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission , and potassium depletion in animals , including humans , results in various cardiac dysfunctions .
Potassium accumulates in plant cells , and thus fresh fruits and vegetables are a good dietary source of it .
Conversely , most plants except specialist halophytes are intolerant of salt , and sodium is present in them only in low concentration .
This resulted in potassium first being isolated from potash , the ashes of plants , giving the element its name .
For the same reason , heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium , and agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of global potassium chemical production .

What is the source of a superhero 's powers ?
Superman ( from DC comics ) was the first superhero created , art by Jim Lee .
A superhero ( sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero ) is a type of stock character possessing `` extraordinary or superhuman powers '' and dedicated to protecting the public .
Since the debut of the prototypical superhero Superman in 1938 , stories of superheroes—ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas—have dominated American comic books and crossed over into other media .
The word itself dates to at least 1917 .
A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine ( also rendered super-heroine or super heroine ) .
`` SUPER HEROES '' is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics .
By most definitions , characters do not strictly require actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes , although terms such as costumed crime fighters or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to those such as Batman and Green Arrow without such powers who share other common superhero traits .
Such characters were generally referred to as `` mystery men '' in the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books to distinguish them from characters with super-powers .
Normally , superheroes use their powers to counter day-to-day crime while also combating threats against humanity by supervillains , their criminal counterparts .
Often , one of these supervillains will be the superhero 's archenemy .
As well , some longrunning superheroes , such as Superman , Batman , Spider-Man and Iron Man each has a rogues gallery of enemies .
As well , superheroes sometimes will combat such irregular threats as aliens , magical/ fantasy entities , American war enemies such as nazism or communism , and godlike or demonic creatures .

None of the 12 officers taken hostage were killed , but seven were treated for injuries caused by beatings and rapes .
This was the third major riot at the NM State Penitentiary , the first occurring on 19 July 1922 and the second on 15 June 1953 .
Author Roger Morris suggests the death toll may have been higher , as a number of bodies were incinerated or dismembered during the course of the mayhem .

`` Red Cardinal '' redirects here .
For the plant Erythrina herbacea , see Coral Bean .
The Northern Cardinal ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) is a North American bird in the genus Cardinalis ; it is also known colloquially as the redbird or common cardinal .
It can be found in southern Canada , through the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and south through Mexico .
It is found in woodlands , gardens , shrublands , and swamps .
The Northern Cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21 centimeters ( 8.3 inches ) .
It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female .
The male is a vibrant red , while the female is a dull red-brown shade .
The Northern Cardinal is mainly granivorous , but also feeds on insects and fruit .
The male behaves territorially , marking out his territory with song .
During courtship , the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak .
A clutch of three to four eggs is laid , and two to four clutches are produced each year .
It was once prized as a pet , but its sale as cage birds is now banned in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 .

when is the feast of St. Rita
Saint Rita of Cascia ( Born Margherita Lotti 1381 - May 22 , 1457 ) was an Italian Augustinian nun , widow and saint venerated in the Roman Catholic Church .
Rita was married at an early age .
The marriage lasted for 18 years , during which she is remembered for her Christian values as a model wife and mother who made efforts to convert her husband from his abusive behavior .
Upon the murder of her husband by another feuding family , she sought to dissuade her sons from revenge .
She subsequently joined an Augustinian community of religious sisters , where she was known for practicing mortification of the flesh , along with the apparent efficacy of her prayers .
St. Rita is venerated due to various miracles attributed to her intercession , and is often portrayed with a bleeding wound on her forehead , which the Roman Catholic Church claims to have been a partial stigmata .
The Roman Catholic Church , under the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII officially canonized Rita on May 24 , 1900 , while her feast day is celebrated every May 22 .
In many pious Catholic countries , Rita is known to be a patroness for abused wives and mourning women .
what is the population of north america
North America is a continent wholly within the Northern Hemisphere and almost wholly within the Western Hemisphere .
It is also considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas .
It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea .
North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ) , about 4.8 % of the planet 's surface or about 16.5 % of its land area .
As of July 2008 , its population was estimated at nearly 529 million people across 23 independent states , representing about 7.5 % of the human population .
North America is the third-largest continent in area , following Asia and Africa , and the fourth in population after Asia , Africa , and Europe .
The first people to live in North America were Paleoindians who began to arrive during the last glacial period by crossing the Bering land bridge .
They differentiated into a number of diverse cultures and communities across the continent .
The largest and most advanced Pre-Columbian civilizations in North America were the Aztecs in what is now Mexico and the Mayans in Central America .
European colonists began to arrive starting in the 16th and 17th centuries , wiping out large numbers of the native populations and beginning an era of European dominance .

The series is noted for the inclusion of many exotic and unique , over the top weapons and devices , a concept that Insomniac Games also expanded into their other games .
what is in a will
A will or testament is a legal declaration by which a person , the testator , names one or more persons to manage his/her estate and provides for the transfer of his property at death .
For the devolution of property not disposed of by will , see inheritance and intestacy .
In the strictest sense , a `` will '' has historically been limited to real property while `` testament '' applies only to dispositions of personal property ( thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as `` Last Will and Testament '' ) , though this distinction is seldom observed today .
A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only after the death of the testator .
where is solar energy present\
The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day .
Solar energy , radiant light and heat from the sun , has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies .
Solar energy technologies include solar heating , solar photovoltaics , solar thermal electricity , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis , which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent energy problems the world now faces .
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute solar energy .
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy .
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air .
In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits .
It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating climate change , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise .
These advantages are global .
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared '' .
where is thomas more buried
Sir Thomas More ( ; 7 February 14786 July 1535 ) , known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935 , was an English lawyer , social philosopher , author , statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist .
He was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and was Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532 .
He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century .
In 2000 , Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians .
More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation , in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale .
However , since 1980 , he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr .
More coined the word `` utopia `` – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation , the political system of which he described in Utopia , published in 1516 .
He opposed the King 's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England , a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534 .
He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act , because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon .
In 1535 , he was tried for treason , convicted on perjured testimony , and beheaded .
More also helped to originate the phrase `` grasp at straws '' to mean `` desperately trying even useless things '' , in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation .
Intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More 's execution .
Erasmus saluted him as one `` whose soul was more pure than any snow , whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like '' .
There was a more controversial side to More 's life , because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith .
However , the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause .
Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was `` the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced '' , a sentiment with which Samuel Johnson agreed .
Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said in 1977 that More was `` the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know , the most saintly of humanists , the most human of saints , the universal man of our cool northern renaissance . ''
what was captain nemo 's nationality ?
Captain Nemo , also known as Prince Dakkar , is a fictional character invented by the French science fiction author Jules Verne .
Nemo appears in two of Verne 's novels , Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ( 1870 ) and The Mysterious Island ( 1874 ) , and makes a cameo appearance in Verne 's play Journey Through the Impossible ( 1882 ) .
Nemo , one of the most famous antiheroes in fiction , is a mysterious figure .
The son of an Indian Raja , he is a scientific genius who roams the depths of the sea in his submarine , the Nautilus , which was built on a deserted island .
Nemo tries to project a stern , controlled confidence , but he is driven by a thirst for vengeance and a hatred of imperialism ( particularly the British Empire ) .
He is also wracked by remorse over the deaths of his crew members and even by the deaths of enemy sailors .
Nemo has appeared in various adaptations of Verne 's novels , including films , where he has been portrayed by a number of different actors .
He has furthermore been adopted by other authors for inclusion in their novels , most notably in Alan Moore 's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Philip José Farmer 's The Other Log of Phileas Fogg .

where is modem on WAN radio internet ?
Acoustic coupler modem
A modem ( modulator-demodulator ) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information , and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information .
The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data .
Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals , from light emitting diodes to radio .
The most familiar example is a voice band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channel .
These signals can be transmitted over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data .
Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time , usually expressed in bits per second ( bit/s , or bps ) , or bytes per second ( B/s ) .
Modems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate , measured in baud .
The baud unit denotes symbols per second , or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal .
For example , the ITU V.21 standard used audio frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ) , to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud .
By contrast , the original ITU V.22 standard , which was able to transmit and receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ) , handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying .
when was the Declaration of Independence Signed ?
The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 , which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states , and no longer a part of the British Empire .
Instead they now formed a new nation—the United States of America .
John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence , which was unanimously approved on July 2 .
A committee had already drafted the formal declaration , to be ready when congress voted on independence .
Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which congress would edit to produce the final version .
The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War .
The national birthday , the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4 , although Adams wanted July 2 .
After ratifying the text on July 4 , Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms .
It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public .
The most famous version of the Declaration , a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence , is displayed at the National Archives in Washington , D.C .
Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4 , the date of its signing was August 2 .
The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have been derived from this original document .
The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry .
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III , and by asserting certain natural and legal rights , including a right of revolution .
Having served its original purpose in announcing independence , the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution .
Since then , it has come to be considered a major statement on human rights , particularly its second sentence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
This has been called `` one of the best-known sentences in the English language '' , containing `` the most potent and consequential words in American history . ''
The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive .
This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln , who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy , and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted .
It has inspired work for the rights of marginalized people throughout the world .
what is the gdp for greenland 2010 ?
The Economy of Greenland can be characterized as small , mixed and vulnerable .
The present economy consists of a big public sector and comprehensive foreign trade , which has resulted in an economy with periods of strong growth , considerable inflation , unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and use of outside , mainly Danish , skilled labor .
GDP per capita is similar to the average European economies but the economy is critically dependent upon substantial support from the Danish government , which supplies about half the revenues of the home rule government who in turn employ about 8,000 Greenlanders out of a labor force of 40,156 ( Jan. 2012 ) .
Unemployment nonetheless remains high , with the rest of the economy dependent upon demand for exports of shrimp and fish .
What is hydrogen in
Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1 .
With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ) , hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form ( H1 ) is the most abundant chemical substance , constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe 's baryonic mass .
Non- remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state .
At standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2 .
Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements .
Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules .
In ionic compounds , it can take a negative charge ( an anion known as a hydride and written as H− ) , or as a positively charged species H+ .
The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species .
The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium ( name rarely used , symbol 1H ) with a single proton and no neutrons .
As the simplest atom known , the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use .
For example , as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation , the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics .
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century , via the mixing of metals with acids .
In 1766–81 , Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance , and that it produces water when burned , a property which later gave it its name : in Greek , hydrogen means `` water-former '' .
Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas , and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water .
Most hydrogen is employed near its production site , with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing ( e.g. , hydrocracking ) and ammonia production , mostly for the fertilizer market .
Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
where was the movie unstoppable directed
Unstoppable is a 2010 American action thriller film directed by Tony Scott , written by Mark Bomback , and starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine .
The film , loosely based on the real-life CSX 8888 incident , tells the story of a runaway freight train , and the two men ( Washington and Pine ) who manage to stop it .
It was Scott 's final feature film before his death in 2012 .
The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 12 , 2010 , and in the United Kingdom on November 24 , 2010 .
It received mostly favorable reviews from film critics ; it garnered a `` Certified Fresh '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based upon aggregated reviews and a rating of `` Generally favorable reviews '' at Metacritic .
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards , but lost to Inception .
what is bracketing in photography
In photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings .
Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot , especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image .
Autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots ( in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot ) .
Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots , it is typically , but not always , used for static subjects .
what is the difference between inside glazed outside glaze
Insulated glazing ( IG ) , more commonly known as double glazing ( or double-pane , and increasingly triple glazing/pane ) are double or triple glass window panes separated by an air or other gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope .
Insulated Glass Units are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 mm to 10 mm or more in special applications .
Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction .
Most units are manufactured with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit .
A sectioned diagram of a fixed Insulated Glazed Unit ( IGU ) , indicating the numbering convention used in this article .
Surface # 1 is facing outside , Surface # 2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane , Surface # 3 is the outside surface of the interior pane , and Surface # 4 is the inside surface of interior pane .
The window frame is labelled # 5 , a spacer is indicated as # 6 , seals are shown in red ( # 7 ) , the internal reveal is on the right hand side ( # 8 ) and the exterior windowsill on the left ( # 9 )
To reduce shear effects on the sealed unit ( a major cause of premature failure ) , manufacturers use a rule of thumb that permits a difference of 1 mm between the thickness of the panes of glass used in the unit and still maintain the warranty for the unit .
For example , a unit may be ordered with a 4 mm pane on the exterior and a 3 mm pane on the interior .
These variations are allowed for architectural and cost reasons .
Other combinations can be specified and produced but the manufacturer may reserve the right to limit the term of the warranty or refuse to warranty the unit altogether .
For ease of description the surfaces of a double paned unit are named according to the following convention : Surface # 1 ( facing outside ) , Surface # 2 ( inside of outside pane ) , Surface # 3 ( outside of inside pane ) and Surface # 4 ( inside surface of inside pane ) .
Applying the corresponding nomenclature for triple paned units results in surfaces # 1 through # 6 .
The performance of insulating glazing can be modified through the use of the following:
A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames .
what is selenium and how used
Selenium is a chemical element with symbol Se and atomic number 34 .
It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its periodic table column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium .
It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature , or as pure ore compounds .
Selenium ( Greek σελήνη selene meaning `` Moon '' ) was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously-known tellurium ( named for the Earth ) .
Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores , where it partially replaces the sulfur .
Commercially , selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores , most often during copper production .
Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known , but are rare .
The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments .
Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells .
Uses in electronics , once important , have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices .
Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot .
Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts , but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms , including all animals .
Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase ( which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants ) .
It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes , which convert one thyroid hormone to another .
Selenium requirements in plants differ by species , with some plants requiring relatively large amounts , and others apparently requiring none .
who were the gop presidential hopefuls in 2006
The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election .
It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 2008 .
Democrat Barack Obama , then the junior Senator from Illinois , defeated Republican John McCain , the senior Senator from Arizona .
As the campaign progressed , the War in Iraq and outgoing Republican President George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular , and the major-party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform .
Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s .
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote .
Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history , and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century .
This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected , having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party .
This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S . Senators , only the third time ( after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S . Senator was elected president , and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President ( Obama and Biden ) were both sitting U.S . Senators .
This was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties ' nominees was the incumbent President or Vice President .
what is prince of monaco last name
The Sovereign Prince or Princess of Monaco is the reigning monarch and head of state of the Principality of Monaco .

The reigning Prince is Albert II .
What is the disk defragmenter tool
Visualization of fragmentation and then of defragmentation
In the maintenance of file systems , defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation .
It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions ( fragments ) .
It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation .
Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together , as they are often accessed in sequence .
Defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives .
The movement of the hard drive 's read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower , compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read/write heads to seek other fragments .
what is level of agreement mean
A service-level agreement ( SLA ) is a part of a service contract where a service is formally defined .
In practice , the term SLA is sometimes used to refer to the contracted delivery time ( of the service or performance ) .
As an example , internet service providers will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level ( s ) of service being sold in plain language terms .
In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures ( MTBF ) , mean time to repair or mean time to recovery ( MTTR ) ; various data rates ; throughput ; jitter ; or similar measurable details .

who is a utilization manager
Utilization management is the evaluation of the appropriateness , medical need and efficiency of health care services procedures and facilities according to established criteria or guidelines and under the provisions of an applicable health benefits plan .
Typically it includes new activities or decisions based upon the analysis of a case .
Utilization management describes proactive procedures , including discharge planning , concurrent planning , pre-certification and clinical case appeals .
It also covers proactive processes , such as concurrent clinical reviews and peer reviews , as well as appeals introduced by the provider , payer or patient .
As pre-certification and concurrent review of cases grew , utilization management spun out of utilization review .
While not synonymous , health care professionals tend to use the terms as interchangeable .
The difference is utilization management is and intends to manage health care cases efficiently and cost effectively before and during health care administration .
Utilization review is more considering whether health care was appropriately applied after it was administered .
There are four basic techniques in utilization management:
Demand Management
Utilization Review
Case Management
Disease Management

what is the salary for a representative
The United States House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the United States Congress ( a bicameral legislature ) .
It is frequently referred to as the House .
The other house is the Senate .
The composition and powers of the House are established in Article One of the United States Constitution .
The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country although its bills must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming law ( unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber ) .
The House has several exclusive powers : the power to initiate revenue bills , to impeach officials , and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College .
Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population but is entitled to at least one representative .
The most populous state , California , currently has 53 representatives .

when was supply chain management developed
A supply chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network .
( cf . Wieland/Wallenburg , 2011 )
A supply chain is a system of organizations , people , activities , information , and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer .
Supply chain activities transform natural resources , raw materials , and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer .
In sophisticated supply chain systems , used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable .
Supply chains link value chains .

what is human skin made of
A close up picture of a rhinoceros skin .
Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates .
Other animal coverings such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin , structure and chemical composition .
The adjective cutaneous means `` of the skin '' ( from Latin cutis , skin ) .
In mammals , the skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue , and guards the underlying muscles , bones , ligaments and internal organs .
Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians , reptiles , and birds .
All mammals have some hair on their skin , even marine mammals which appear to be hairless .
The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors .
For example , the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss .
Its other functions are insulation , temperature regulation , sensation , and the production of vitamin D folates .
Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue .
This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented .
The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism .
In humans for example , the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick , and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as `` crows feet '' and wrinkles .
The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the thickest skin in the body .
Fur is dense hair .
Primarily , fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage .
On some animals , the skin is very hard and thick , and can be processed to create leather .
Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection , and birds have hard feathers , all made of tough β- keratins .
Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier to passage of chemicals and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces .
For example , a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly , as the chemical diffuses through its skin .

what is the average time it takes to go through aa 12 step program
A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles ( accepted by members as 'spiritual principles , ' based on the approved literature ) outlining a course of action for recovery from , compulsion , or other behavioral problems .
Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) as a method of recovery from alcoholism , the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous : The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939 .
The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs .
As summarized by the American Psychological Association , the process involves the following:
admitting that one can not control one 's addiction or compulsion ;
recognizing a higher power that can give strength ;
examining past errors with the help of a sponsor ( experienced member ) ;
making amends for these errors ;
learning to live a new life with a new code of behavior ;
helping others who suffer from the same addictions or compulsions .

what was the Germans ' last offensive on the western Front during World war 2
Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the German Army opened the Western Front by first invading Luxembourg and Belgium , then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France .
The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne .
Following the race to the sea , both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches , stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France .
This line remained essentially unchanged for most of the war .
Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front .
The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances .
However , a combination of entrenchments , machine gun nests , barbed wire , and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders .
As a result , no significant advances were made .
Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun with a combined [ estimated ] 700,000 dead , the Battle of the Somme with more than [ an estimated ] million casualties , and the Battle of Passchendaele with roughly [ an estimated ] 600,000 casualties .
In an effort to break the deadlock , this front saw the introduction of new military technology , including poison gas , aircraft and tanks .
But it was only after the adoption of improved tactics that some degree of mobility was restored .
The German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front .
Using the recently-introduced infiltration tactics , the German armies advanced nearly to the west , which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough .
In spite of the generally stagnant nature of this front , this theater would prove decisive .
The inexorable advance of the Allied armies during the second half of 1918 persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable , and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice .
The terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 .

what is pitch in climbing
Multi-pitch climbing is the ascent of climbing routes with one or more stops at a belay station .
Each section of actual climbing between stops at the belay stations is called a pitch .
The leader ascends the pitch , placing gear and stopping to anchor themselves to the belay station .
The reason for the stops can be determined by choice , convention or necessity .
For example:
The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch ( necessity ) .
The leader has run out of protective gear ( necessity ) .
There is a convenient protectable ledge , or fixed bolts placed by previous climbers , at the location for a belay station ( convention ) .
The leader chooses to rest or exchange leads before the next section of the climb ( choice ) .
The general purpose of these stops is to allow the second to ascend to the point of the lead climber while collecting the protective gear from the route in the course of the lead climber 's ascent .
At the belay station , the protective gear is collected , possibly exchanged to a new leader , and the leader of the next pitch ascends the route .
what is the defensive line in football called
A diagram showing an I Formation on offense and a 4-3 Formation on defense
In American football , each team has eleven players on the field at one time .
The specific role that a player takes on the field is called their position .
Under the modern rules of American football , teams are allowed unlimited subsititutions , that is teams may change any number of players after any play .
This has resulted in the development of three `` platoons '' of players , the offense ( the team with the ball , who is trying to score ) , the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring , and to take the ball from them ) , and the special teams ( who play in kicking situations ) .
Within those platoons , various specific positions exist depending on what the player 's main job is .
what is tylenol 3 on schedule of drugs
The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 .
The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture , importation , possession , use and distribution of certain substances is regulated .
The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs .
The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ) , with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each .
Two federal agencies , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration , determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules , though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing , and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000 , which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate in Schedule I . Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse ( an undefined term ) , currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , and international treaties .
what is the address of mother 's park & ride in wayne nj
The Wayne Route 23 Transit Center is a New Jersey Transit park-and-ride station in Wayne , New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line that provides bus service to New York City and various other points in the area as well as Montclair-Boonton Line train service to New York , Hoboken , and intermediate points along the line between Hackettstown and Montclair State University .
It is located off of the southbound lanes of New Jersey Route 23 on West Belt Road , near the interchange where Route 23 , Interstate 80 , and U.S. Route 46 meet , across from the Willowbrook Mall .
The station opened in January 2008 and has 1,000 parking spaces .
New Jersey Transit intends for this combined rail and bus station to become an `` interceptor station , '' that will help relieve the habitual congestion at the West Belt Road Interchange , where the three major highways meet .
In addition , the construction of the station was meant to also ease the congestion at what was then Route 23 Park & Ride , a bus depot on Route 23 North that has since been renamed Mother 's Park & Ride , and the Willowbrook Mall Park & Ride ; the now-Mother 's site had limited parking while NJT was having trouble with overfull parking areas at Willowbrook .
The Wayne Township bus garage is located on the opposite side of Route 23 .
There has been a proposal to build a parking deck with another thousand spots and develop the land at the station .
In addition to Montclair-Boonton trains , the Transit Center is served by the following New Jersey Transit bus lines:
75 to Newark Penn Station and Butler
194 to Port Authority Bus Terminal and Butler/Newfoundland
198 to Port Authority Bus Terminal and William Paterson University
324 to Port Authority and Wayne Route 23
748 to Willowbrook Mall and Paterson
what is the @ sign called ?
The at sign @ is also commonly called the at symbol , ampersat , apetail or commercial at in English—and less commonly a wide range of other terms .
The fact that there is no single word in English for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the French arobase or Spanish and Portuguese arroba—or to coin new words such as asperand , ampersat—but none of these has achieved wide currency .
Originally an accounting and commercial invoice abbreviation meaning `` at the rate of '' ( e.g . 7 widgets @ $ 2 = $ 14 ) , it was not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters , but was on at least one 1889 model and the very successful Underwood models from the `` Underwood No . 5 '' in 1900 onward .
It is now universally included on computer keyboards .
In recent years , its meaning has grown to include the sense of being `` located at , '' `` and , '' or `` directed at '' , especially in email addresses and social media , particularly Twitter .

There are approximately 642 skeletal muscles within the typical human , and almost every muscle constitutes one part of a pair of identical bilateral muscles , found on both sides , resulting in approximately 320 pairs of muscles , as presented in this article .
Nevertheless , the exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles differently , e.g . regarding what is defined as different parts of a single muscle or as several muscles .
Examples range from 640 to 850 .
The muscles of the human body can be categorized into a number of groups which include muscles relating to the head and neck , muscles of the torso or trunk , muscles of the upper limbs , and muscles of the lower limbs .

what is base operations & maintenance
Mechanical repair
Maintenance , repair , and operations ( MRO ) or maintenance , repair , and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical , plumbing or electrical device should it become out of order or broken ( known as repair , unscheduled or casualty maintenance ) .
It also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order ( known as scheduled maintenance ) or prevent trouble from arising ( preventive maintenance ) .
MRO may be defined as , `` All actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function .
The actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative , managerial , and supervision actions . ''
MRO operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer , i.e . a service is being offered , or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase ( Guadette , 2002 ) .
In the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organisation or smaller operation .
The former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance , repair or of the product .
The latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture .
The main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product .
Neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant .

What is the enzyme responsible for transferring electrons to oxygen in the electron transport chain ?
The electron transport chain in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes .
The NADH and succinate generated in the citric acid cycle are oxidized , providing energy to power ATP synthase .
Photosynthetic electron transport chain of the thylakoid membrane .
An electron transport chain ( ETC ) couples electron transfer between an electron donor ( such as NADH ) and an electron acceptor ( such as O2 ) with the transfer of H+ ions ( protons ) across a membrane .
The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .
Electron transport chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions , such as the oxidation of sugars ( respiration ) .
In chloroplasts , light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH with transfer of H+ ions across chloroplast membranes .
In mitochondria , it is the conversion of oxygen to water , NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate that are required to generate the proton gradient .
Electron transport chains are major sites of premature electron leakage to oxygen , generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress .
what is in ultram
Tramadol hydrochloride ( trademarked as Conzip , Ryzolt , Ultracet , Ultram in the USA , Ralivia , Zytram XL Durella { CR-100/200 mg } in Canada or Adolonta in Spain ) is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain .
The drug has a wide range of applications , including treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , restless legs syndrome , motor neurone disease and fibromyalgia .

Tramadol and its major metabolite ( s ) are distinguished from other more potent opioid agonists by relative selectivity for μ-opioid receptors .
what was bernie madoff selling
Bernard Lawrence `` Bernie '' Madoff ( ; born April 29 , 1938 ) is an American former stockbroker , investment advisor , financier , and white collar criminal .
He is the former non-executive Chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history .
Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960 , and was its chairman until his arrest on December 11 , 2008 .
The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street , which bypassed `` specialist '' firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers .
He employed at the firm his brother Peter as Senior Managing Director and Chief Compliance Officer ; Peter has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison .
Peter 's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm 's rules and compliance officer and attorney , and his sons Andrew and Mark ( Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father 's arrest ) .
On December 10 , 2008 , Madoff 's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme , and quoted him as describing it as `` one big lie . ''
The following day , FBI agents arrested Madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) had previously conducted investigations into Madoff 's business practices , but did not uncover the massive fraud .
In March 2009 , Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars .
Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s .
However , federal investigators believe the fraud began as early as the 1970s , and those charged with recovering the missing money believe the investment operation may never have been legitimate .

where was tycho brahe when he discovered mars
Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague
Tycho Brahe ( 14 December 154624 October 1601 ) , born Tyge Ottesen Brahe , was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations .
He was born in Scania , then part of Denmark , now part of modern-day Sweden .
Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist .
In his De nova stella ( On the new star ) of 1573 , he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm .
His precise measurements indicated that `` new stars , '' ( stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena , and were therefore not `` atmospheric '' tailless comets as previously believed , but were above the atmosphere and moon .
Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena , as previously thought , and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres .
As an astronomer , Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe , the Tychonic system .
Furthermore , he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers , working without telescopes for his observations .
Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements , and later Stjerneborg , underground , when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady .
On the island ( on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for printing his results .
After disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597 , he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague , where he became the official imperial astronomer .
He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou .
Here , from 1600 until his death in 1601 , he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho 's astronomical data to develop Kepler 's laws of planetary motion .
WHERE IS GOCHEOK DONG BRANCH
Guro District ( Guro-gu ) is a district of Seoul , South Korea , which was separated from Yeongdeungpo District on April 1 , 1980 .
Located in the southwestern part of the city , where besides Yangcheon District and Geumcheon District Guro District has an important position as a transport link which contains railroads , land routes from the rest of Seoul to the south of the country .
The Gyeongbu and Gyeongin railway lines connect Seoul to Busan and Incheon .
In addition , Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines 1 , 2 , and 7 , and major highways intersect in Guro District .
The name Guro originates from the legend that nine ( ) old men ( Korean : ro ) enjoyed longevity in the district .
A digital industrial complex is located in Guro District .
The Guro Digital Industrial Complex , which played a leading industrial role mainly with textile manufacturing , dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967 , has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex .
This complex played a pivotal role in the economic growth of the South Korea 's development era , referred to as the `` Miracle on the Han River `` , and also contributed 10 percent of national export in the 1970s .
Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul .
The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories are moving from the area and the council is developing what it terms its four zones .
An `` e-government `` system based on this hosted the international e-participation forum on February 7–9 , 2007 , with the participation of more than thirty-seven countries .
The forum was launched with the theme `` Promoting Democracy and Regional Development '' and twenty-five mayors including André Santini ( Issy-les-Moulineaux , France ) , Kevin Foy ( Chapel Hill , US ) , Apirak Kosayothin ( Bangkok , Thailand ) , Uvais Mohamed Emthiyas ( Colombo , Sri Lanka ) , and world experts such as Dr William H. Dutton ( Director of Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford , UK ) and Dr Ari-Veiko Anttiroiko ( professor at the University of Tampere , Finland ) participated in the forum .
The Guro Declaration , adopted during the forum , aims to set up a portal site for e-government development and to establish a concrete project in order to bridge the digital divide among the world 's cities .
This practice has been recognised for providing a new important step in the development of e-democracy .
The e-participation forum was a key factor for Guro to play the leading role in bridging the digital divide among cities , to provide I.T . enterprises located in Guro Digital Industrial Complex the opportunity to launch into the international market , to improve its image and become a global leader to concrete e-democracy .

who is inventor of the radio
Many people were involved in the invention of radio as we now know it .
Several possible methods of wireless communication were considered , including inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground , however the method used for radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves .
After early speculation on the subject , experimental work on the connection between electricity and magnetism began around 1820 with the work of Hans Christian Ørsted and continued with the work of André-Marie Ampère , Joseph Henry , and Michael Faraday .
These investigations culminated in the complete theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell .
This theory described the theoretical basis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves .
After Maxwell 's theory was published many people experimented with wireless communication , some intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some not .
It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by David Edward Hughes around 1880 , although this was considered to be induction at the time .
The first systematic and unequivocal transmission of EM waves was performed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz and described in papers published in 1887 and 1890 .
Hertz famously considered these results as being of little practical value .
After Hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves .
Others , notably Guglielmo Marconi , were concerned with practical improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy .
Later on Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to send an audio signal by means of electromagnetic waves .
what is scurvy disease
Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C , which is required for the synthesis of collagen in humans .
The chemical name for vitamin C , ascorbic acid , is derived from the Latin name of scurvy , scorbutus , which also provides the adjective scorbutic ( `` of , characterized by or having to do with scurvy '' ) .
Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy , followed by formation of spots on the skin , spongy gums , and bleeding from the mucous membranes .
Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs , and a person with the ailment looks pale , feels depressed , and is partially immobilized .
As scurvy advances , there can be open , suppurating wounds , loss of teeth , jaundice , fever , neuropathy and death .
Scurvy was at one time common among sailors , pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods .
It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c . 380 BC ) , and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory .
Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel , often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages .
This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century , continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century .
While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency , until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932 , numerous theories and treatments were proposed , often on little or no experimental data .
This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept , an inability to reliably link different foods ( notably present in fresh citrus , watercress , and organ meat ) to scurvy .
An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron , thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time .
Treatment by fresh food , particularly citrus fruit , was periodically implemented , as it had been since antiquity .
However until the 1930s , treatment was inconsistent , with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century .
It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy , James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book , A Treatise of the Scurvy , though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades .
In infants , scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease , named after Sir Thomas Barlow , a British physician who described it .
However , Barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse .
Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease .
Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C .
However , humans and other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ) , guinea pigs , most or all bats , and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet .
Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues , with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits ) , tomatoes , potatoes , cabbages , and green peppers .
what is iron made of
Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe ( from ) and atomic number 26 .
It is a metal in the first transition series .
It is the most common element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a whole , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core .
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust .
Iron 's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars , where the production of nickel-56 ( which decays to the most common isotope of iron ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic .
This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space .
Like other group 8 elements , iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states , −2 to +6 , although +2 and +3 are the most common .
Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments , but is reactive to oxygen and water .
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray , but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust .
Unlike many other metals which form passivating oxide layers , iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal , and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion .
Iron metal has been used since ancient times , though copper alloys , which have lower melting temperatures , were used first in history .
Pure iron is soft ( softer than aluminium ) , but is unobtainable by smelting .
The material is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process , such as carbon .
A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % and 2.1 % ) produces steel , which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron .
Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces , where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron , which has a high carbon content .
Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel .
Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the most common metals in industrial use , due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron .
Iron chemical compounds , which include ferrous and ferric compounds , have many uses .
Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction , used in welding and purifying ores .
It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens .
Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene , the first sandwich compound discovered .
Iron plays an important role in biology , forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates .
Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals .

what is the ph of potato chips ?
A potato chip ( known as a chip in American , Australian , New Zealand , Canadian , Singaporean , Hong Kong , South African and Jamaican English ; as a crisp in British English and Hiberno-English , and as either a chip or wafer in Indian English ) is a thin slice of potato that is deep fried or baked until crunchy .
Potato chips are commonly served as an appetizer , side dish , or snack .
The basic chips are cooked and salted ; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings , herbs , spices , cheeses , and artificial additives .
`` Crisps '' , however , may also refer to many different types of savory snack products sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland , some made from potato , but may also be made from maize , tapioca or other cereals .
An example of these kinds of savory snacks is Monster Munch .
Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food market in English-speaking countries and numerous other Western nations .
The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US $ 16.4 billion in 2005 .
This accounted for 35.5 % of the total savory snacks market in that year ( US $ 46.1 billion ) .
what was henry clay 's political party
Henry Clay , Sr. ( April 12 , 1777 – June 29 , 1852 ) was a lawyer , politician and skilled orator who represented Kentucky in both the Senate and in the House of Representatives .
He served three different terms as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and was also Secretary of State from 1825 to 1829 .
He lost his campaigns for president in 1824 , 1832 and 1844 .
Clay was a dominant figure in both the First and Second Party systems .
As a leading war hawk in 1812 , he favored war with Britain and played a significant role in leading the nation to war in the War of 1812 .
In 1824 he ran for president and lost , but threw his electoral votes to John Quincy Adams , who made him secretary of state as the Jacksonians denounced what they considered a `` corrupt bargain . ''
He ran and lost again in 1832 and 1844 as the candidate of the Whig Party , which he founded and usually dominated .
Clay was the foremost proponent of the American System , fighting for an increase in tariffs to foster industry in the United States , the use of federal funding to build and maintain infrastructure , and a strong national bank .
He opposed the annexation of Texas , fearing it would inject the slavery issue into politics .
Clay also opposed the Mexican-American War and the `` Manifest Destiny `` policy of Democrats , which cost him votes in the close 1844 election .
Dubbed the `` Great Pacificator , '' Clay brokered important compromises during the Nullification Crisis and on the slavery issue .
As part of the `` Great Triumvirate `` or `` Immortal Trio , '' along with his colleagues Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun , he was instrumental in formulating the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850 .
He was viewed as the primary representative of Western interests in this group , and was given the names `` Henry of the West '' and `` The Western Star . ''
A plantation owner , Clay held slaves during his lifetime but freed them in his Will .
Abraham Lincoln , the Whig leader in Illinois , was a great admirer of Clay , saying he was `` my ideal of a great man . ''
Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay 's economic programs .
In 1957 , a Senate Committee selected Clay as one of the five greatest U.S . Senators , along with Daniel Webster , John C. Calhoun , Robert La Follette , and Robert Taft .

what was the distance of evacuation from the russian nuclear meltdown
Location of Chernobyl nuclear power plant
The abandoned city of Pripyat with Chernobyl plant in the distance
Abandoned housing blocks in Pripyat
The Chernobyl disaster ( , Chornobylska Katastrofa – Chornobyl Catastrophe ) was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine ( then officially the Ukrainian SSR ) , which was under the direct jurisdiction of the central authorities of the Soviet Union .
An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe .
The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history , and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale ( the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 ) .
The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles .
The official Soviet casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed , and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for .

when was Saddle Creek founded
Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha , Nebraska .
Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship , the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 ( as Lumberjack Records ) .
Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel .
The label is named after Saddle Creek Road , a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha , and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst ( then a solo artist , currently of Bright Eyes , Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band , Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk ) , Tim Kasher ( then of Slowdown Virginia , currently of Cursive and The Good Life ) , and others .
Collectively , they were known unofficially as the `` Creekers '' .
Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer , offering to `` Spend an evening with Saddle Creek '' ( later to be the title of the label 's DVD . )
Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship .
Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance , which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella .
Saddle Creek Records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called `` The Omaha Sound `` , characterized by a slight country twang .
This is increasingly inaccurate , though , with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles .
The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek 's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history ; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together .
A `` sister label '' , of sorts , to Saddle Creek is Team Love , started by Conor Oberst in 2004 .
The label opened arms to their first bands not based in Omaha in 2001 with releases by Now It 's Overhead and Sorry About Dresden .
Other non-Nebraskan artists followed , including Los Angeles 's Rilo Kiley , Eric Bachmann ( formerly leader of Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers from North Carolina ) , Georgie James ( Washington D.C. ) , Two Gallants ( San Francisco ) , and most recently Tokyo Police Club ( Toronto ) .
In 2005 , Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek , a documentary detailing the first ten years of the record label 's history , was released .
The DVD features extensive interviews with the Saddle Creek bands , archival footage , and rare live performances .
On June 8 , 2007 , the label opened their own music venue named Slowdown ( after the group Slowdown Virginia ) , located in downtown Omaha , Nebraska .

What was distinguished about the Stamp Act from previous taxes
Notice of Stamp Act of 1765 in Newspaper
American newspapers reacted to the Stamp Act with anger and predictions of the demise of journalism .
The Stamp Act 1765 ( short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765 ; 5 George III , c. 12 ) imposed a direct tax by the British Parliament specifically on the colonies of British America , and it required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London , carrying an embossed revenue stamp .
These printed materials were legal documents , magazines , newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies .
Like previous taxes , the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency , not in colonial paper money .
The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years ' War .
The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence , and should pay at least a portion of the expense .
The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies .
The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament , and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised , how they were levied , or how they would be spent .
Many colonists considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent —consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant .
Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests .
The Stamp Act Congress held in New York City , reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure , also petitioned Parliament and the King .
Local protest groups , led by colonial merchants and landowners , established connections through correspondence that created a loose coalition that extended from New England to Georgia .
Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved .
Very soon all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions , and the tax was never effectively collected .
Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies .
British merchants and manufacturers , whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax , also pressured Parliament .
The Act was repealed on March 18 , 1766 as a matter of expedience , but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the Declaratory Act .
There followed a series of new taxes and regulations , likewise opposed by the colonists .
The episode played a major role in defining the grievances and enabling the organized colonial resistance that led to the American Revolution in 1775 .
where were pt boat hulls made in ww2 ?
PT-105 underway .
PT boats were a variety of torpedo-armed fast attack craft used by the United States Navy in World War II to attack larger surface ships .
`` PT '' is the US hull classification symbol for `` Patrol Torpedo '' .
The PT boat squadrons were nicknamed `` the mosquito fleet '' .
The Japanese called them `` Devil Boats '' .
The original pre– World War I torpedo boats were designed with `` displacement '' hulls .
They displaced up to 300 tons and the top speed was .
The PT boats used in World War II were built using the planing -type hull form developed for racing boats .
They were much smaller ( 30–75 tons ) and faster ( 35–40 knots ) .
Both types were designed to strike at larger warships with torpedoes , using relatively high speed to get close , and small size to avoid being spotted and hit by gunfire .
They were much less expensive than large warships .
PT boats were much faster , smaller , and cheaper than conventional ( displacement hull ) vessels .
During World War II , American PT boats engaged enemy destroyers and numerous other surface craft , ranging from small boats to large supply ships .
PT boats also operated as gunboats against enemy small craft , such as armored barges used by the Japanese forces for inter-island transport .
What is the significance of Good Friday ?
Good Friday is a religious holiday observed primarily by Christians commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary .
The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday , and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover .
It is also known as Holy Friday , Great Friday , Black Friday , or Easter Friday , though the latter properly refers to the Friday in Easter week .
Based on the details of the Canonical gospels , the Crucifixion of Jesus was most likely to have been on a Friday ( the day before the Sabbath ) ( ) .
The estimated year of the Crucifixion is AD 33 , by two different groups , and originally as AD 34 by Isaac Newton via the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars and the crescent of the moon .
A third method , using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model ( consistent with Apostle Peter 's reference to a `` moon of blood '' in Acts 2:20 ) , points to Friday , 3 April AD 33 .

what was the date of pearl harbor
The attack on Pearl Harbor ( called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning ) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor ) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , on the morning of December 7 , 1941 ( December 8 in Japan ) .
From the standpoint of the defenders , the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time .
The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States .
The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters , bombers and torpedo planes in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .
All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four being sunk .
Two of these were later raised , and with the remaining four repaired , six battleships returned to service later in the war .
The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer .
188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded .
Important base installations such as the power station , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked .
Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 65 servicemen killed or wounded .
One Japanese sailor was captured .
The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters .
The following day ( December 8 ) , the United States declared war on Japan .
Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong , disappeared .
Clandestine support of Britain ( for example the Neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance .
Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11 , which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day .
There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan .
However , the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy `` .

Sections of US 85 are considered part of the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway .
who was the republican candidate for president in the 1969 elections
The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 5 , 1968 .
The Republican nominee , former Vice-President Richard Nixon , won the election over the Democratic nominee , incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey .
Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities , torn by riots and crime .
Analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years .
Coming four years after Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won in a historic landslide , the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a Republican elected for the first time in twelve years .
It was a wrenching national experience , conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation , the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses , and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again .
The election featured the strongest third party effort since 1912 by former Alabama Governor George Wallace , a Democrat .
Because Wallace 's campaign opposed federal intervention in the South to end school segregation , he carried the Deep South and ran well in ethnic industrial districts in the North .
This was the last election in which New York had the most votes in the electoral college ( 43 votes ) .
After the 1970 census , California gained the most electoral votes and has remained the most populous state since then .
This is the latest election where a presidential ticket won without carrying the vice presidential candidate 's home state .
where is the processes tab located on windows xp
Windows Task Manager is a task manager or System monitor application included with the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems that provides limited information about computer performance and running applications , processes and CPU usage , commit charge and memory information , network activity and statistics , logged-in users , and system services ( and as often is the case with software tools provided by Microsoft for Windows , 3rd party software is available which fills the requirements more thoroughly , e.g , `` Process Explorer '' , `` Extended Task Manager '' , `` Anvir Task Manager '' , `` Process Hacker '' , and `` System Explorer '' ) .
The Task Manager can also be used to set process priorities , processor affinity , forcibly terminate processes , and shut down , restart , hibernate or log off from Windows .
Windows Task Manager was introduced with Windows NT 4.0 .
Previous versions of Windows NT included the Task List application , which had far fewer features .
The task list was capable of listing currently running processes and killing them , or creating a new process .
In Windows XP only , a Shutdown menu is also present that allows access to Standby , Hibernate , Turn off , Restart , Log Off and Switch User .
Earlier versions of Microsoft Windows ( Microsoft Windows 3.x , Windows 95 , Windows 98 ) had a program known as tasks to display the programs currently running .
This file was executed by running the taskman.exe file from the C : \Windows directory .
what is the kanji for language

who was the first civilian to make a magnetic compass
A simple dry magnetic portable compass .
A smartphone that can be used as a compass because of the magnetometer inside .
An iPhone that can be used as a geological compass because of the 3-axis teslameter and 3-axis accelerometer inside it
A military compass that was used during World War I .
A compass is a navigational instrument that shows directions in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the surface of the earth .
The frame of reference defines the four cardinal directions ( or points ) – north , south , east , and west .
Intermediate directions are also defined .
Usually , a diagram called a compass rose , which shows the directions ( with their names usually abbreviated to initials ) , is marked on the compass .
When the compass is in use , the rose is aligned with the real directions in the frame of reference , so , for example , the `` N '' mark on the rose really points to the north .
Frequently , in addition to the rose or sometimes instead of it , angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass .
North corresponds to zero degrees , and the angles increase clockwise , so east is 90 degrees , south is 180 , and west is 270 .
These numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings , which are commonly stated in this notation .
The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han Dynasty ( Since about 206 BC ) .
The compass was used in Song Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040-1044 , and was used for maritime navigation by 1111 to 1117 .
The use of a compass is recorded in Western Europe between 1187 and 1202 , and in Persia in 1232 .
The dry compass was invented in Europe around 1300 .
This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass .
what was the height of the inca empire
The Inca Empire or Inka Empire ( Quechua : Tawantinsuyu ) was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America .
The administrative , political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru .
The Inca civilization arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century .
From 1438 to 1533 , the Incas used a variety of methods , from conquest to peaceful assimilation , to incorporate a large portion of western South America , centered on the Andean mountain ranges , including , besides Peru , large parts of modern Ecuador , western and south central Bolivia , northwest Argentina , north and central Chile , and southern Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia .
The official language of the empire was Quechua , although hundreds of local languages and dialects of Quechua were spoken .
The Inca referred to their empire as Tawantinsuyu which can be translated as The Four Regions or The Four United Provinces .
There were many local forms of worship , most of them concerning local sacred `` Huacas `` , but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti —the sun god—and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama .
The Incas considered their King , the Sapa Inca , to be the `` child of the sun . ''
where are the kidneys in your body
The kidneys are organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in most animals , including vertebrates and some invertebrates .
They are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes , maintenance of acid–base balance , and regulation of blood pressure ( via maintaining salt and water balance ) .
They serve the body as a natural filter of the blood , and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary bladder .
In producing urine , the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium , and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water , glucose , and amino acids .
The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol , erythropoietin , and the enzyme renin .
Located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum , the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries , and drain into the paired renal veins .
Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter , itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder .
Renal physiology is the study of kidney function , while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases .
Diseases of the kidney are diverse , but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features .
Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes , renal cysts , acute kidney injury , chronic kidney disease , urinary tract infection , nephrolithiasis , and urinary tract obstruction .
Various cancers of the kidney exist ; the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma .
Cancers , cysts , and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney , or nephrectomy .
When renal function , measured by glomerular filtration rate , is persistently poor , dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options .
Although they are not severely harmful , kidney stones can be painful and a nuisance .
The removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces , which are then passed through the urinary tract .
One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp pain in the medial/lateral segments of the lower back .

what is negligence in tort ?
Negligence ( Lat . negligentia , from neglegere , to neglect , literally `` not to pick up something '' ) is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances .
The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by carelessness , not intentional harm .
According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law ;
`` The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people . ''
`` those who go personally or bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision . ''
Fletcher v Rylands ( [ 1866 ] LR 1 Ex 265 )
Through civil litigation , if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause their injury , they can recover damages to compensate for their harm .
Proving a case for negligence can potentially entitle the injured plaintiff to compensation for harm to their body , property , mental well-being , financial status , or intimate relationships .
However , because negligence cases are very fact-specific , this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury .
Further , the law of negligence at common law is only one aspect of the law of liability .
Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action , the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases .
what is an intradermal nevus
A melanocytic nevus ( also known as `` Nevocytic nevus '' ) is a type of lesion that contains nevus cells ( a type of melanocyte ) .
Some sources equate the term mole with `` melanocytic nevus '' .
Other sources reserve the term `` mole '' for other purposes .
The majority of moles appear during the first two decades of a person’s life , while about one in every 100 babies is born with moles .
Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm , while congenital moles , or congenital nevi , are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma .
A mole can be either subdermal ( under the skin ) or a pigmented growth on the skin , formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte .
The high concentration of the body’s pigmenting agent , melanin , is responsible for their dark color .
Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi .
what is AST and ALT on complete metabolic panel
The comprehensive metabolic panel , or chemical screen , ( CMP ; CPT code 80053 ) is a panel of 14 blood tests which serves as an initial broad medical screening tool .
The CMP provides a rough check of kidney function , liver function , and electrolyte and fluid balance , but it is far from perfect .
Abnormal values from a CBC may be a result of false positives and thus the CBC may need to be repeated for a patient ( or replaced with a more specific test ) .
The CMP is an expanded version of the basic metabolic panel ( BMP ) , which does not include liver tests .
A CMP ( or BMP ) can be ordered as part of a routine physical examination , or may be used to monitor a patient with a chronic disease , such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension .
Previous names for the panel of tests have been Chem 12 , Chemistry panel , Chemistry screen , SMA 12 , SMA 20 and SMAC ( Sequential Multiple Analysis - Computer ) .
The tests are performed on machines based on the AutoAnalyzer invented in 1957 .
Where are most of the natural gas
Natural gas extraction by countries in cubic meters per year .
Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide , nitrogen , and hydrogen sulfide .
Natural gas is an energy source often used for heating , cooking , and electricity generation .
It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals .
Natural gas is found in deep underground natural rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates .
Petroleum is also another resource found in proximity to and with natural gas .
Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic .
Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments .
Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .
Before natural gas can be used as a fuel , it must undergo processing to remove impurities , including water , to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas .
The by-products of processing include ethane , propane , butanes , pentanes , and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons , hydrogen sulfide ( which may be converted into pure sulfur ) , carbon dioxide , water vapor , and sometimes helium and nitrogen .
Natural gas is often informally referred to simply as gas , especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal .
who is the girl in imagination movers
This page is about the Imagination Movers band .
For information about the TV show starring the band , see Imagination Movers ( TV series ) .
Imagination Movers is a band formed in New Orleans , Louisiana , in 2003 .
The lineup includes Rich Collins , Scott Durbin , Dave Poche , and Scott `` Smitty '' Smith .
Members of the group were longtime friends and neighbors .
The group started as a television/music concept which was pitched to local PBS affiliates in New Orleans .
WLAE-TV was the first to take an interest in the group and later introduced them to Beth Courtney , the President & Chief Executive Officer at Louisiana Public Broadcasting .
Soon after , LPB began airing one-minute videos produced by the Imagination Movers themselves .
The Movers built a sizable regional following by setting educational songs for kids to melodies and rhythms that adults appreciate as well .
They sold more than 100,000 copies of their self-produced CDs and DVDs .
Their three indie CDs : `` Good Ideas , '' `` Calling All Movers , '' and `` Eight Feet '' along with their grass roots DVD `` Stir It Up '' have , combined , won fourteen national awards , from such groups as the National Association of Parenting Publications ( NAPPA ) and Parents ' Choice .
In early 2005 , Disney took notice , and initiated negotiations to add the Movers to the company 's roster .
These were interrupted in August when the flood protection designed and built by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect New Orleans failed .
The resulting floodwater claimed the band 's office , as well as the homes of Collins , Durbin and Poche – but the deal was signed in the spring of 2006 .
In 2008 , Walt Disney Records introduced the Imagination Movers ' music to the nation with the release of the Movers ' first nationally-released CD , `` Juice Box Heroes . ''
In September 2008 , a 30-minute show featuring the group began airing on the Disney Channel 's preschool programming block known as Playhouse Disney , and currently airs on Playhouse Disney 's replacement , Disney Junior .
The Movers write and perform all the songs on their show .
Moreover , the Imagination Movers have received critical kudos for their live concert performances .
In October 2009 , the Imagination Movers started the `` Live from the Idea Warehouse Concert Tour 2009 '' .
Traveling from mid-October to mid-December 2009 their live performances include lots of their favorite songs and dancing , as well as video appearances of Warehouse Mouse .
Beginning in early-February 2011 and wrapping up in late May 2011 , the Imagination Movers presented their `` In a Big Warehouse Concert Tour , '' playing more than 100 shows in 50+ cities across North America .
From March to October 2012 , the Imagination Movers toured North America on their post-Disney `` Rock-O-Matic '' tour .
The show maintained several elements of the original TV concept , such as an on-stage `` idea emergency '' and several sets from their older catalogue ; however , with the departure of Wendy Calio back to her native Hawaii , the character `` Nina '' , along with her musical numbers , is not present .
The tour promotes the Imagination Movers ' new album/DVD release , `` Rock-O-Matic '' , which features all new music from the band .
The album itself is produced independently of Disney and has a notably more mature , contemporary rock-and-roll sound , though still very appropriate for children .
Several performance dates were moved to later in 2012 to benefit from the increased exposure of the Imagination Movers TV show now playing daily on Disney Junior .
what is plural for platypus
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia , including Tasmania .
Together with the four species of echidna , it is one of the five extant species of monotremes , the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth .
It is the sole living representative of its family ( Ornithorhynchidae ) and genus ( Ornithorhynchus ) , though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record .
The unusual appearance of this egg-laying , duck -billed , beaver -tailed , otter -footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it , with some considering it an elaborate fraud .
It is one of the few venomous mammals , the male platypus having a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans .
The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia ; it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the reverse of its 20-cent coin .
The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales .
Until the early 20th century , it was hunted for its fur , but it is now protected throughout its range .
Although captive breeding programmes have had only limited success and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution , it is not under any immediate threat .
where is the chupacabra found
The Chupacabra or Chupacabras ( , from chupar `` to suck '' and cabra `` goat '' , literally `` goat sucker '' ) is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas .
It is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in Puerto Rico ( where these sightings were first reported ) , Mexico , and the United States , especially in the latter 's Latin American communities .
The name comes from the animal 's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock , especially goats .
Physical descriptions of the creature vary .
Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico , and have since been reported as far north as Maine , and as far south as Chile , and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and The Philippines .
It is supposedly a heavy creature , the size of a small bear , with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail .
Sighting reports of the Chupacabra have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence , while most reports in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange .
Biologists and wildlife management officials view the chupacabra as a contemporary legend .
What is the purpose of North American Free Trade Agreement
The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) is an agreement signed by Canada , Mexico , and the United States , creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America .
The agreement came into force on January 1 , 1994 .
It superseded the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. , Canada , and Mexico
NAFTA has two supplements : the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation ( NAAEC ) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation ( NAALC ) .
what is the ideal mean radiant temperature
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation ( ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 55 ) .
Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC ( heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ) design engineers .
The Predicted Mean Vote ( PMV ) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models .
It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions .
Because the PMV model was derived from data collected in a controlled climate , it is not suitable for applications in naturally ventilated spaces which often have high levels of air movement .
This shortcoming motivated the development of a family of empirical statistical models of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated spaces known as adaptive models .
Adaptive models of thermal comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with their environment , and controlling their thermal comfort by means of clothing or window-opening and closing .
This is in contrast to thermal comfort in sealed buildings , in which occupants experience the environment passively .
Thermal comfort is affected by heat conduction , convection , radiation , and evaporative heat loss .
Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate , thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings .
It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling hot or cold is not just dependent on air temperature alone .
Thermal comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be freely performed with the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE-55 .

where are sumitomo tires made
Headquarters ( Kobe , Japan )
( ) is a tire and rubber company based in Japan .
It is part of the Sumitomo Group .
The company traces its origins to 1909 , when the Sumitomo Group made an investment in Dunlop Japan , the newly formed Japanese subsidiary of the British company Dunlop Rubber .
Over the years Sumitomo and Dunlop developed a close business relationship , and in 1963 the Sumitomo Group acquired control of Dunlop Japan and renamed it Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd .
In 1985 , when Dunlop Rubber was taken over by BTR plc , the company acquired the automobile tire assets of Dunlop , including the right to use the Dunlop brand on automobile tires .
The acquisition did not include the US and Australian businesses , which were separately owned , but in 1986 Sumitomo also acquired the Dunlop Tire Corporation of the US from its management .
In 1997 , Sumitomo formed a joint venture with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , by which Goodyear and Sumitomo agreed to manufacture tires for each other 's markets , including Dunlop branded tires .
As part of the agreement , Goodyear acquired 75 % interests in Dunlop Tyres , the UK company which Sumitomo had formed , and in Dunlop Tire Corporation .
Goodyear and Sumitomo also made investments in each other .
Today , the company makes a wide range of rubber based products , including automobile tires , golf balls and tennis balls .

what is in the alpine mountain systems
The Alps are one of the great mountain range systems of Europe stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries from Austria and Slovenia in the east , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Germany , France to the west and Italy and Monaco to the south .
The mountains were formed over hundreds of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided .
Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn .
Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border , and at is the highest mountain in the Alps .
The Alpine region area contains many peaks higher than , known as the `` four-thousanders `` .
The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones .
Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations .
Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Paleolithic era .
A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991 .
By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La Tène culture was well established .
Hannibal may have crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region .
In 1800 Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 .
The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists , writers , and artists , in particular the Romantics , followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks .
In World War II the Third Reich invaded the Alpine countries , with the exception of Switzerland and Liechtenstein ; Adolf Hitler kept a base of operation in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war .
The Alpine region has a strong cultural identity .
The traditional culture of farming , cheesemaking , and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages , although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century .
The Winter Olympic Games have been hosted in the Swiss , French , Italian , Austrian and German Alps .
At present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors .
what is the name of the family guy episode where lois 's sister has a baby

It is spoken by 27 % of Basques in all territories ( 714,136 out of 2,648,998 ) .
Of these , 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part .
In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in Spain and France , it is customary to refer to three ancient provinces in France and four Spanish provinces .
Native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the Spanish autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre and in the western half of the French département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques .
The Basque Autonomous Community is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic Basque Country incorporating the traditional Spanish provinces of Biscay , Gipuzkoa , and Álava , which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions .
These provinces and many areas of Navarre are heavily populated by ethnic Basques , but Basque was , at least until the 1990s , not spoken as a native language in most of Álava , western parts of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre , either because it had been replaced by Spanish along the centuries , in some areas , or because it had never been spoken there , in other areas .
In southwestern France , the ancient Basque-populated provinces were Labourd , Lower Navarre , and Soule .
They and other regions were consolidated into a single département in 1790 under the name Basses-Pyrénées , a name which persisted until 1970 .
A standardized form of the Basque language , called Euskara Batua , was developed by the Basque Language Academy in the late 1960s .
Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations ( education , mass media , literature ) , and this is its main use today .
The role of this standard Basque language depends on the linguistic educational model of each region and each school .
In most areas of the Spanish Basque Country , the educational Model D , where all subjects are taught in Basque , except `` Spanish language and literature '' ( which is taught in Spanish ) is now the predominant model .
In France , the Basque language school Seaska and the association for a bilingual ( Basque and French ) schooling Ikasbi meet a wide range of Basque language educational needs up to the Sixth Form , while often struggling to surmount financial and administrative constraints .
Apart from this standardized version , there are five main Basque dialects : Bizkaian , Gipuzkoan , and Upper Navarrese in Spain , and Navarrese–Lapurdian and Zuberoan ( in France ) .
Although they take their names from the mentioned historic provinces , the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries .
what were hamilton 's goals for establishing a national bank
The President , Directors and Company , of the Bank of the United States , commonly known as the First Bank of the United States , was a central bank , chartered for a term of twenty years , by the United States Congress on February 25 , 1791 .
Establishment of the Bank was included in a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power ( along with a federal mint and excise taxes ) championed by Alexander Hamilton , first Secretary of the Treasury .
Hamilton believed a central bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation 's credit , and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution .
Officially proposed to the first session of the First Congress in 1790 , Hamilton 's Bank faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power .
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition , which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional , and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population .
The First Bank building is now a National Historic Landmark located in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania within Independence National Historical Park .

what is human chorionic
In molecular biology , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception .
Later during pregnancy it is made by the developing placenta , and later by the placental component syncytiotrophoblast .
Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone ; therefore , elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis .
However , it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis .
The pituitary analogue of hCG , known as luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages .
, the FDA has prohibited the sale of `` homeopathic '' and over the counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal .

what is the 8-fold plan to end suffering
The Dharma wheel , often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path
The Noble Eightfold Path ( , ) is one of the principal teachings of the Buddha , who described it as the way leading to the cessation of suffering ( dukkha ) and the achievement of self-awakening .
It is used to develop insight into the true nature of phenomena ( or reality ) and to eradicate greed , hatred , and delusion .
The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Buddha 's Four Noble Truths ; the first element of the Noble Eightfold Path is , in turn , an understanding of the Four Noble Truths .
It is also known as the Middle Path or Middle Way .
All eight elements of the Path begin with the word `` right '' , which translates the word samyañc ( in Sanskrit ) or sammā ( in Pāli ) .
These denote completion , togetherness , and coherence , and can also suggest the senses of `` perfect '' or `` ideal '' .
'Samma ' is also translated as `` wholesome '' , `` wise '' and `` skillful '' .
In Buddhist symbolism , the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the dharma wheel ( dharmachakra ) , whose eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path .

What is an economic feature ?
Economics is the social science that analyzes the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services .
The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek ( ' , `` management of a household , administration '' ) from ( ' , `` house '' ) + ( ' , `` custom '' or `` law '' ) , hence `` rules of the house ( hold ) '' .
Political economy was the earlier name for the subject , but economists in the late 19th century suggested `` economics '' as a shorter term for `` economic science '' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to `` mathematics `` , `` ethics '' , and so forth .
A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work .
Consistent with this , a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics .
Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy , including individual agents ( such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers ) and markets , and their interactions .
Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it , including unemployment , inflation , economic growth , and monetary and fiscal policy .
Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics ( describing `` what is '' ) and normative economics ( advocating `` what ought to be '' ) ; between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioral economics ; and between mainstream economics ( more `` orthodox '' and dealing with the `` rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus '' ) and heterodox economics ( more `` radical '' and dealing with the `` institutions-history-social structure nexus '' ) .
Economic analysis may be applied throughout society , as in business , finance , health care , and government , but also to such diverse subjects as crime , education , the family , law , politics , religion , social institutions , war , and science .
At the turn of the 21st century , the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism .
An increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability ; this area of research is known as Ecological economics .

what is the average american income
US county household median income 2009 .
Median US household income , 2001-2011
Household income is a measure commonly used by the United States government and private institutions .
Each household is measured by the income of every resident over the age of 15 .
Income includes wages and salaries , unemployment insurance , disability payments , child support payments received , regular rental receipts , as well as any personal business , investment , or other kinds of income received routinely .
While inflation-adjusted ( `` real '' ) household income had been increasing almost every year from 1945 to 1999 , it has since been flat and even decreased recently .
U.S. median household income fell from $ 51,144 in 2010 to $ 50,502 in 2011 .
Extreme poverty in the United States , meaning households living on less than $ 2 per day before government benefits , doubled from 1996 to 1.5 million households in 2011 , including 2.8 million children .
The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
As households tend to share a similar economic context , the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income .
That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories , and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible .

what is section eight housing
Section 8 housing in the South Bronx
Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 ( ) , often simply known as Section 8 , as repeatedly amended , authorizes the payment of rental housing assistance to private landlords on behalf of approximately 3.1 million low-income households .
It operates through several programs , the largest of which , the Housing Choice Voucher program , pays a large portion of the rents and utilities of about 2.1 million households .
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development manages the Section 8 programs .
The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides `` tenant-based '' rental assistance , so a tenant can move from one unit of at least minimum housing quality to another .
It also allows individuals to apply their monthly voucher towards the purchase of a home , with over $ 17 billion going towards such purchases each year ( from ncsha.org analysis ) .
The maximum allowed voucher is $ 2200 a month .
Section 8 also authorizes a variety of `` project-based '' rental assistance programs , under which the owner reserves some or all of the units in a building for low-income tenants , in return for a Federal government guarantee to make up the difference between the tenant 's contribution and the rent for 1 cent in the owner 's contract with the government .
A tenant who leaves a subsidized project will lose access to the project-based subsidy .
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Veterans Affairs have a special Section 8 program called VASH ( Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing ) , or HUD-VASH , which gives out a certain number of Section 8 vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans .
